      <description>Minecraft has entered The Copper Age! Express yourself in every shade of copper as you transform this versatile metal into handy tools, shiny armor, gleaming light sources, oxidizing decor, smart storage, and even lively mechanical companions known as copper golems.
In addition to these shiny new features, this drop comes with a bunch of technical news and fixes. The End now has a flashing skylight, you can populate the world with NPCs called mannequins, and item sprites can now be added into text. Whether scraped or oxidized, this is the start of a new clonking era of creativity!

Copper Chest

The Copper Chest is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants
Copper Chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other Copper blocks
A Copper Chest can be crafted using a Chest and 8 Copper Ingots

Copper Golem

The Copper Golem is a new mob which can be spawned by placing a Jack o&apos;Lantern or Carved Pumpkin on top of a Copper block
Copper Golems oxidize over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
If the Copper Golem is fully oxidized and not waxed it will turn into a Copper Golem Statue

Upon turning into a statue, the Copper Golem will drop any item it may be holding
The statue retains the Copper Golem&apos;s name


Copper Golems can help with sorting items into Chests
Interacting with the Copper Golem with an empty hand will make it drop its carried item
Iron Golems will occasionally plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem

The flower can be removed with Shears
This flower is dropped when the Copper Golem turns into a Copper Golem Statue




Copper Golem Item Sorting

If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item

The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items
It can pick up at most 16 items in a stack at a time
Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up


If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in

The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items
It can place an item in a Chest if it&apos;s empty, or if it contains the same type of item that it is holding in its hand


The Copper Golem will visit at most 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item
If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again
The search area for chests from the Copper Golem&apos;s position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks


Copper Golem Statue Block

The Copper Golem Statue is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants
The Copper Golem Statue oxidizes over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
If the Copper Golem Statue has no oxidation when interacted with using an Axe, the statue will turn into a Copper Golem
The Copper Golem Statue can be in one out of four poses: standing, sitting, running, and star

The pose of the statue can be changed by interacting with it
Each pose emits a Redstone Comparator signal




Copper Equipment

Added Copper Nugget
Added Copper armor

Added Copper Helmet, Copper Chestplate, Copper Leggings and Copper Boots
Copper armor has higher durability than Leather and Gold
Copper armor has slightly less enchantability than Iron


Added Copper tools and weapons

Added Copper Axe, Copper Hoe, Copper Pickaxe, Copper Shovel and Copper Sword
Copper tools and weapons do the same amount of damage as Stone, but have higher durability
Copper tools work faster and last longer than Stone
Copper tools have higher enchantability than Diamond, but slightly less than Iron


Copper equipment can be crafted using Copper Ingots
Copper equipment can be repaired with Copper Ingots
Copper equipment turns into a Copper Nugget when smelted
Added Copper Horse Armor

Has the same loot table and chance of generating as Iron Horse Armor
Armor toughness: 4




Copper Decorations

Added Copper Torch

A green variant of the Torch crafted from a Copper Nugget, Coal, and Stick
Functionally identical to the Torch


Added Copper Bars

Functionally identical to the existing Iron Bars block
Made from copper and oxidizes over time


Added Copper Chain

Functionally identical to the existing Chain block (now renamed to Iron Chain)
Made from copper and oxidizes over time


Added Copper Lantern

Crafted similarly to a regular Lantern but uses Copper and a Copper Torch
The lantern itself oxidizes, changing its look as it ages
Functionally identical to the Lantern




Shelf

The Shelf is a new type of decorative block which comes in the following variants:

Oak
Spruce
Birch
Jungle
Acacia
Dark Oak
Mangrove
Cherry
Pale Oak
Bamboo
Crimson
Warped


The Shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any Stripped Log, Stripped Stem or Block of Stripped Bamboo, filling the top and bottom row

This recipe produces 6 Shelves


The Shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:

Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player&apos;s main hand item with the content of that slot
The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame


While a Shelf is powered by Redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it&apos;s powered

When powered, up to 3 Shelves will connect to each other
Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player&apos;s hotbar
Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player&apos;s hotbar
Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player&apos;s hotbar
It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with




Lightning Rod

Lightning Rods now oxidize like other Copper blocks

The End Light Flashes

The End dimension now has skylight

Normally the skylight does not affect how the dimension looks
From time to time flashes in the sky happen and produce a rumbling sound
When they happen skylight intensity increases, flooding the dimension with purple light


While the Ender Dragon fog effect is active the flash source in the sky is not visible and the brightness of the light affecting the world is reduced
The &quot;Hide Sky Flashes&quot; accessibility option disables the End flashes

When the flash is disabled by the setting the world is not lit by the flash but the flash source is still visible in the sky and the sound effect still plays




Minecraft Server Management Protocol
Added a server management API (JSON-RPC over WebSocket) for dedicated servers

The API is disabled by default and can be enabled in server.properties

management-server-enabled=true
management-server-host=localhost
management-server-port=0


The API is accessible at ws://&lt;management-server-host&gt;:&lt;management-server-port&gt; when enabled
Supports querying and updating of server state (players, allowlist, operators, settings, game rules)
Sends notifications on state changes (e.g. player joins, game rule updates)
Calling {&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;rpc.discover&quot;} returns an API schema containing supported methods and notifications of the currently running server
The Data Generator produces an API schema (json-rpc-api-schema.json) in the reports output folder mirroring the contents returned by the rpc.discover method
The API adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification

Uses namespaced methods and the reserved namespaces are minecraft (e.g. minecraft:players, minecraft:allowlist/add)

Extensible via custom namespaces for additional methods and events


Core method groups: players, allowlist, operators, server (save, stop), server settings, game rules
Example method call:

Request: {&quot;method&quot;:&quot;minecraft:allowlist/add&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;params&quot;:[[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;jeb_&quot;}]]}

Response: {&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;result&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;jeb_&quot;}]}



Example notification:

{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;minecraft:notification/players/joined&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;jeb_&quot;}]}


Example error:

Request: {&quot;method&quot;: &quot;minecraft:foo/bar&quot;,&quot;id&quot;: 1}

Response: {&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;result&quot;:{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;error&quot;:{&quot;code&quot;:-32601,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Method not found&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:&quot;Method not found: minecraft:foo/bar&quot;}}}

Errors and error codes follow JSON-RPC 2.0 error object format



Clients must authenticate to access the API

Clients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server-specific secret
The secret is configured in server.properties

management-server-secret=
The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty
Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized




TLS is enabled by default

Can be disabled in server.properties

management-server-tls-enabled=false


Requires a keystore file to be set in server.properties

management-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12


The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format
Keystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority

Environment variable: MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD

JVM argument: -Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password=

Server property: management-server-tls-keystore-password=






Chat Drafts

Unsent chat messages now get saved as Chat Drafts if the chat was forcibly closed

This includes it being closed by external sources such as dying or a dialog opening, but not the player intentionally closing their chat


Any existing Chat Draft will get pre-filled into the message box the next time the chat is opened
Draft text has a grayed-out appearance until fully restored

Draft text can be restored as regular text by interacting with it:

Typing additional text
Moving the text cursor using the arrow keys
Clicking it
Highlighting it


Pressing enter on a Chat Draft prior to it being restored sends it like a normal chat message
Pressing backspace on a Chat Draft prior to it being restored deletes it


Added an option to the Chat Settings screen that enables saving unsent chat messages by default

With this option enabled, unsent messages will always get saved as Chat Drafts, even if the player intentionally closed their chat



Server Code of Conduct
When connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown

Accepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server
A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future

If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again



Server Setup

A new boolean field has been added to server.properties called enable-code-of-conduct

Setting it to true will make the server look for Code of Conduct files in the codeofconduct subfolder in the same folder as server.properties

Each file in the folder should have the form &lt;language_code&gt;.txt and be UTF-8 encoded

The language shown will attempt to match the player&apos;s language
If it doesn&apos;t exist, the en_us Code of Conduct will be used
If that also doesn&apos;t exist, an arbitrary available entry is used





Sounds

Some sound sliders in the Music &amp; Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world

Accessibility

The &quot;Attack/Destroy&quot; and &quot;Use Item/Place Block&quot; key binds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either &quot;Hold&quot; or &quot;Toggle&quot; in the Controls screen
Added &quot;Invert Mouse X&quot; option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis
Added &quot;Sprint Window&quot; option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint
Multiple key binds that have the same key assigned to them can now work together, while before only one would work

For example, you can now bind D to Jump and Strafe Left to jump and strafe left at the same time
The red warning for assigning the same key to multiple key binds is changed to yellow


The spectator hotbar menu key can now be rebound

It is part of a new Spectator category in the Key Binds screen, alongside the pre-existing Highlight Players key bind



Changes

Performance improvements
The Chain block has been renamed to &quot;Iron Chain&quot;
Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful

The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg


Changes to world loading and the &quot;Spawn Chunks&quot;
A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered &quot;active&quot; and will keep processing chunks and entities

Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded


Reworked the debug overlay to be less cluttered and more configurable
Players seen in the game world of the current server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen even if they are offline
Players now stop flying when switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode if they are near the ground

A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats...) within 1 block below them
Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity

This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground




Migrated several server properties into game rules
OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements


Developer’s Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirement has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.

Performance Improvements

Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance

You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms
FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs


Particles outside the player&apos;s view are not rendered anymore, which provides a performance improvement in some cases

World Loading and Spawn Chunks

The concept of fixed &quot;Spawn Chunks&quot; has been removed
The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were:

Chunks loaded by the forceload command
Chunks active due to portal activity
Thrown Ender Pearls (Singleplayer only)
A small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only)
Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only)


The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn
The loading screen now has a progress bar

This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading mentioned above




Developer’s Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into.


However, we also want to recognize that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option.


We believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or Ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking.

Server Properties
Several server properties were removed in favor of making them into game rules, allowing these settings to be changed while the server is running

Removed server property allow-nether in favor of the new game rule allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals

Removed server property spawn-monsters in favor of the new game rule spawnMonsters

Removed server property enable-command-block in favor of the new game rule commandBlocksEnabled

Removed server property pvp in favor of the new game rule pvp

Added server property management-server-enabled controlling whether the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is enabled or not

Defaults to false



Added server property management-server-port controlling on what port the Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started

Defaults to 0, assigning an available port each time management server is started


Added server property management-server-host controlling with what host the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started

Defaults to localhost



Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not

Defaults to true



Added server property management-server-tls-keystore controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS

Defaults to an empty string
A dedicated server won&apos;t start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided


Added server property management-server-tls-keystore-password controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS

Defaults to an empty string


Added server property status-heartbeat-interval controlling the interval the management server sends heartbeat notifications to connected clients

Defaults to 0, meaning it’s disabled


Added server property enable-code-of-conduct

Details on this property can be found in the &quot;Server Setup&quot; header



Game Rules

Removed spawnChunkRadius game rule
Added pvp game rule controlling whether players can deal damage to other players

Defaults to true



Added allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals game rule controlling if the Nether can be entered through portals

Defaults to true

Defaults to true



Added spawnerBlocksEnabled game rule controlling if Spawner Blocks should be enabled or not

Defaults to true




Mob Spawning

The logic for choosing a type of equipment for mobs spawning with equipment has been tweaked to add Copper as a possibility

The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between Leather, Copper and Gold
The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87%



Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

Test Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads
Ambient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the game

The underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction
This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or &quot;hollow&quot; such as:

Worn armor
Worn Elytra
The outside layers on player skins
The rib cages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses
The feet of Chickens or Frogs
The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon
The fins on fish
And more!





Recipes

Changed the Copper Trapdoor recipe to use 4 Copper Ingots instead of 6 and now yields one Copper Trapdoor instead of two

Sounds

The Happy Ghast is now audible from 64 blocks
Sounds for Chests now play at a lower volume
The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value
The &quot;Voice/Speech&quot; sound source has been rephrased to &quot;Narrator/Voice&quot;

UI

The Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box
More text inputs now support selecting text by mouse dragging
Double-clicking a word in an edit box now selects it
When adding a new server to the server list, the server name is no longer prefilled

When omitted, the default name &quot;Minecraft Server&quot; is used



Mouse cursor

Some UI components will now change the shape of the mouse cursor

Examples: text inputs, numeric sliders, buttons, scroll bars


Additionally, clickable parts of text labels (like links) will now change the cursor to the &quot;hand&quot; shape
This feature can be disabled with the &quot;Allow Cursor Changes&quot; option in the Mouse Settings screen

Debug Overlay

The debug overlay is accessible by pressing F3, as before
The debug overlay can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world
It is now less cluttered, displaying less information by default
Added a new Debug Options screen, available by pressing F3 + F6, which can be used to configure what debug information should be displayed

For each element, you can configure whether it should be visible in the debug overlay or not, and can even set it to always be visible regardless of the debug overlay being active
Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this Debug Options screen
Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the Debug Options screen
The state of the Debug Options screen is saved between launches of the game
The Debug Options screen has the following preset profiles:


Default resets everything to the default state

Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible






Developer&apos;s Note: Previously, gathering the information every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check your FPS noticeably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in the Performance profile should not affect game performance.

Chat

It is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal
The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension

Accessibility

Dye Colors now have updated icons

The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility


A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen

The &quot;Auto-Jump&quot; option, as well as the &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Sprint&quot; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen


The &quot;Show Subtitles&quot; option has been rephrased to &quot;Closed Captions&quot; to more accurately describe what it does
The &quot;Hide Lightning Flashes&quot; accessibility setting has been renamed to &quot;Hide Sky Flashes&quot; as it includes the End light flashes

Technical Changes

Pack versions now have minor versions
The Data Pack version is now 88.0
The Resource Pack version is now 69.0
Some previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players

Pack Formats

The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions

A minor version increment of the game&apos;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working


Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version

Pack Metadata
The pack.mcmeta format has been updated:

The supported_formats field has been removed

If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack &lt; 82, resource pack &lt; 65), it is still required
Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed


The pack_format field is now optional

If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack &lt; 82, resource pack &lt; 65), it is still required


Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported

A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1]

Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0]

Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone


Added required field max_format - specifies the maximum version supported

A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1]

Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff

Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone


For overlay entries:

The formats field has been removed

If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack &lt; 82, resource pack &lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions
Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed


Added required fields min_format and max_format with the same formats as the fields above with the same name for the pack section



Debug Features

Some debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players
Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties:

First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true

Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true

To get the list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES



Warning: this is debug code, and the primary intention is to help modders - not for normal play. Handle with extreme care!

Features can crash your game or corrupt your worlds
Features are not guaranteed to work as intended
Features might be added, changed or removed without a notice



Data Pack Versions 82.0 Through 88.0

Added Mannequin entities
World Borders can now be set per dimension
Added a way to use GUI and item sprites in text
Player profiles in data components and block entities no longer resolve automatically
Added fetchprofile command for downloading player profiles
Renamed chain to iron_chain


Mannequins
Added a new type of technical entity called minecraft:mannequin which can only be spawned with summon commands.

A Mannequin is a Player Avatar without a connected Player
Mannequins show a description text (by default entity.minecraft.mannequin.label) where a Player&apos;s below_score score would show
Mannequins function as Living Entities - they can hold and wear equipment, have attributes &amp; effects, take damage, etc.
Mannequins accept the minecraft:profile component from spawner items

Data Fields:


profile - Which Player profile to show on the entity (same format as a minecraft:profile component), defaults to {} (i.e. static profile with both id and name missing)

hidden_layers - List of outer skin layers to hide

Valid entries: cape, jacket, left_sleeve, right_sleeve, left_pants_leg, right_pants_leg, hat




pose - The pose of the mannequin

Valid entries: standing, crouching, swimming, fall_flying, sleeping




main_hand - Which hand is the main hand of the Mannequin - one of left and right


immovable - Optional boolean specifying that the Mannequin cannot be moved (defaults to false)

description - Optional Text Component shown where a Player&apos;s below_score score would show

The default entity.minecraft.mannequin.label text is shown if omitted



hide_description - Optional boolean specifying that no description should be shown at all

A Mannequin with the description hidden displays as if a Player had no below_score display




World Border

The World Border is now dimension-specific

This means that each dimension can have its own World Border size, position, etc.



Text Rendering

object Text Component

New text component with type object has been added
This component will display a non-character object as a part of text
Sprites are always rendered as a rectangle, 8x8 pixels in size

Bold and italics styles are ignored


Format:


object: type of object, string, see below for values

&lt;type-specific&gt;: additional fields depending on object type


Similarly to the nbt text component, the object field can be omitted

However, it&apos;s recommended to provide it for error checking



atlas Object Type

Renders a single sprite from a sprite atlas as a character
Format:


atlas: namespaced ID of a sprite atlas, default value: minecraft:blocks


sprite: namespaced ID of a sprite in the atlas, for example item/porkchop




General note about atlas contents:

Sprite Atlases contain textures for items, blocks, mob effects, GUI elements, etc.
The contents are controlled by files in the assets/minecraft/atlases/ directory in a resource pack
The current contents can be reviewed with the F3+S key combination

player Object Type

Renders a player head
If a partial profile is given, the skin is resolved in the same way as the minecraft:profile component on a player head
Format:


player: player profile


name: player name, optional string

id: player uuid, optional UUID

properties: profile properties, optional map



hat: controls rendering of a hat layer, boolean, default true





run_command Click Event

Previously, if the command field contained a command that required a signed message (/say, /me, /msg, /tell, /w, /teammsg, /tm), it would be silently discarded
Instead, a screen will be shown that lets the user insert the command into the chat window or copy the command to their clipboard if the chat window can&apos;t be opened

Commands

The summon command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful
The spawnpoint and setworldspawn commands now have control over the full player look direction

The angle argument has been removed
Added an optional rotation argument which requires both yaw and pitch to be specified


The setworldspawn command is no longer limited to the Overworld

This means players can respawn e.g. in the Nether when they have no Bed or Respawn Anchor


Server commands now run from the respawn dimension by default instead of always running in the Overworld

Added fetchprofile


A new command that has been added to fetch the contents of a player profile from Minecraft servers
Since the operation might take some time, it works asynchronously while the game keeps running
After successful completion, a message will be printed that lets the user perform various actions:

Copy the contents of a fully resolved minecraft:profile component
Get a Player Head with the resolved profile
Summon a Mannequin with the resolved profile
Copy a text component to display the player head in text


Since the result is not known at the time of execution, this command always returns 1


Syntax:


fetchprofile name &lt;player name&gt; - resolves profile by name (case-insensitive)

fetchprofile id &lt;uuid&gt; - resolves profile by id

Data Components
Modified minecraft:profile

New Resolution Behavior

Previously the contents of this component would permanently change when the profile was resolved, i.e. downloaded from Minecraft services
To avoid issues with this unexpected change, the resolved value is no longer stored and contents of the profile will always remain unchanged
That means this component now has two behaviors:

Static: when it has the properties field or when both name and id are present or when both are missing

In this state, the profile will always render as-is
If the properties field is missing, a default skin will be used (selected based on id, same as in offline mode)
That means the skin will be frozen at the moment of component creation
This option is preferred for decorative uses


Dynamic: when it has either name or id set (but not both)

When an item containing this profile is rendered on the client side, the profile will be resolved to most recent value
This means that this item will always render with the current skin of the targeted player

Note: if a player changes their skin while the game is running, the change will not be visible until the client restarts


The resolution might happen with a delay, during which the item will render with a default skin
The profile name will replace the item name only when it is present

Items with just id will show the default name


Items with dynamic profiles are distinguished from static ones with a label in their tooltip




Items stack based on exact contents, so even if a dynamic component is eventually resolved to the same profile as a static one, they won&apos;t stack together
Player heads in older maps that have not been loaded in newer versions yet will usually be converted to dynamic contents

Player Skin Overrides

Profiles can now also have additional fields that can replace various values used for rendering
If any of the fields are omitted, the value from the resolved profile is used, even if the profile resolves to the default skin
New fields


texture - Optional namespaced ID of the skin texture to use for rendering

The skin is specified relative to the textures folder and with a .png suffix
e.g. entity/player/wide/steve will use the default wide Steve skin



cape - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use for rendering

When specified, uses the same format as the texture field



elytra - Optional namespaced ID of the Elytra texture to use for rendering

When specified, uses the same format as the texture field
If this value is not present either as an override or in a player profile, Mannequins using this profile will use the cape texture, or if that is also not present, the default Elytra texture when wearing an Elytra



model - Optional model type, one of wide and slim





blocks_attacks Item Component

If the damage reduced in an attack is 0, for example by the angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking

Entity Data
Modified minecraft:player


Changes to the respawn object


angle has been renamed to yaw and is now a required field

pitch has been added as a required field

dimension is now a required field



Block Entity Data
Modified minecraft:skull



profile field has been changed to match minecraft:profile component

That means that it also becomes immutable and is resolved only when necessary



Loot Tables

Added minecraft:entity_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters:


target_entity, the entity being interacted with

interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the target_entity


tool, the tool used to interact with target_entity



Added minecraft:block_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters:


block_state, the block state of the block entity being interacted with

block_entity, the optional block entity being interacted with

interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the block_state


tool, the optional tool used to interact with block_state



Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as entity_properties.entity, can additionally target the target_entity and interacting_entity parameter types
Added charged_creeper/root loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper

This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables:

charged_creeper/piglin
charged_creeper/creeper
charged_creeper/skeleton
charged_creeper/wither_skeleton
charged_creeper/zombie


Once any killed mob drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table


Added brush/armadillo loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed
Added gameplay/turtle_grow loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult
Added harvest/beehive loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears

New field: block_particles - specifies per-block particles. Each block particle is randomly chosen according to weights. A set limit of block particles is spawned each tick from all explosions that tick.
Format: List of entries:


weight: Non-negative integer representing the random weight for this entry being chosen

particle: The particle to spawn

scaling: Optional scaling to apply between explosion center and block position, or 1.0 if not specified

speed: Optional scaling to apply to the speed of the particle, or 1.0 if not specified

World Generation

The initial_density_without_jaggedness field in noise_settings definitions has been replaced with a preliminary_surface_level field


initial_density_without_jaggedness was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than 0.390625


preliminary_surface_level is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface
The minecraft:find_top_surface density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning



Density Functions
Added minecraft:find_top_surface

Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function
It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive

The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface as possible for best performance
The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface



Fields:


density - density function to approximate the surface of

upper_bound - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value

lower_bound - integer, lowest possible y-value

cell_height - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan

Added minecraft:invert

Resolves to 1/argument


Fields:


argument - density function

Jigsaw Structures

The max_distance_from_center field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal

This can be specified by an object with fields:


horizontal - required integer between 1 and 128


vertical - optional integer between 1 and 4096 (default: 4096)
e.g.: &quot;max_distance_from_center&quot;: { &quot;horizontal&quot;: 20, &quot;vertical&quot;: 500 }



The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported

Shaders &amp; Post-process Effects

Developer&apos;s Note: Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game&apos;s internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.

Shaders

The following unused shaders have been removed:

core/position_color_lightmap.vsh
core/position_color_lightmap.fsh
core/position_color_tex_lightmap.vsh
core/position_color_tex_lightmap.fsh


A new PER_FACE_LIGHTING flag has been added to the following shaders:

core/entity.vsh
core/entity.fsh


When set, cardinal lighting will be computed separately for front- and back-faces
As we now require OpenGL 3.3, we have bumped the version of all shaders from 150 to 330


Changes to Full Screen Passes

The following vertex shaders have been removed, and replaced by core/screenquad.vsh:

core/blit_screen.vsh
post/blit.vsh
post/blur.vsh
post/invert.vsh
post/sobel.vsh
post/screenquad.vsh


Vertex shaders for post-processing effects, as well as lightmap generation and full screen blits are no longer are passed the Position attribute, and instead must assign vertex coordinates by gl_VertexID

These passes furthermore are only executed with 3 vertices, instead of a full quad

      <description>Posted: 30 September 2025Minecraft has entered The Copper Age! Express yourself in every shade of copper as you transform this versatile metal into handy tools, shiny armor, gleaming light sources, oxidizing decor, smart storage, and even lively mechanical companions known as copper golems. Whether scraped or oxidized, this is the start of a new clonking era of creativity! Unearth the power of copper in Minecraft now!Features and Bug FixesCopper ChestCopper chests are a new block! Summon a copper golem to get your first copper chest, which you can leave to oxidize, or keep pristine with wax. Drop items into a copper chest, and then sit back and relax as your copper golem sorts them into normal chests around your base!
Copper Chest is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants
Copper Chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other Copper blocks
Copper Chests can be crafted using a Chest and Copper Ingots
Copper EquipmentWhat comes between stone and iron? Now the answer is: copper! Craft tools, weapons, and armor from copper, giving this early-game ore more uses than ever before. Unlike copper blocks, these items won&apos;t oxidize, but like all copper blocks - they will look beautiful!
Copper armor has higher durability than leather but less than iron. Copper armor enchantability sits slightly lower than with iron
Copper equipment turns into Copper Nuggets when smelted
Hostile Monsters have a chance to spawn with Copper Armor equipped
Hostile Monsters can pick up and use Copper Weapons and Armor
Added Copper Horse Armor
Has the same loot table and chance of generating as Iron Horse Armor
Armor toughness: 4


Copper GolemCopper golems are handy, organization-loving companions that’ll bring your base to life! Summoned with copper and carved pumpkins, the copper golem removes items you leave in copper chests and sorts them based on the item type into chests around your base!
Copper Golem will drop between 1 and 3 Copper Ingots when killed
Copper Golem can help with sorting items into Chests
If the Copper Golem has fully oxidized it will turn into a Copper Golem Statue Block
When turned into a Copper Golem Statue block, it will freeze in a random pose
When turned into a Copper Golem Statue the Copper Golem will drop any item it may be holding
A Copper Golem turned into a Copper Golem Statue will keep its name if named with a Name Tag
Interacting with the Copper Golem with an empty hand will drop its carried item
Iron Golems will sometimes plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem
Copper Golem Item Sorting
If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item
The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items
It can pick up max 16 items in a stack at a time
Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up
If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in
The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items
It can place an item in a Chest if it&apos;s empty, or if it contains the same type of item it is holding in its hand
The Copper Golem will visit max 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item
If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again
The search area for chests from the Copper Golem&apos;s position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks
Copper Golem Statue Block
Copper Golem Statue Block is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants
Copper Golem Statue Block oxidizes over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
The pose of the block can be changed by interacting with it
If the Copper Golem Statue Block has no oxidation when interacted with using an Axe, the block will turn into a Copper Golem again
When connected to a Redstone Comparator, the Copper Golem Statue Block emits a Redstone signal based on its current pose
Copper Decorations
Added Copper Torch
A green variant of the Torch crafted from a Copper Nugget, Coal, and Stick
Functionally identical to the Torch


Added Copper Bars
Functions like the existing Iron Bars block
Made from copper and oxidizes over time


Added Copper Chain
Functions like the existing Chain block (now renamed to Iron Chain)
Made from copper and oxidizes over time


Added Copper Lantern
Crafted similarly to a regular Lantern but uses Copper and a Copper Torch
The lantern itself oxidizes, changing its look as it ages
Functionally identical to the Lantern


Shelf
The Shelf is a new type of decorative block which comes in the following variants:
Oak
Spruce
Birch
Jungle
Acacia
Dark Oak
Mangrove
Cherry
Pale Oak
Bamboo
Crimson
Warped


The Shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any Stripped Log, Stripped Stem, or Block of Stripped Bamboo, filling the top and bottom rowThis recipe produces 6 Shelves

The Shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:
Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player&apos;s main hand item with the content of that slot
The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame


While a Shelf is powered by Redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it&apos;s powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect
Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player&apos;s hotbar
Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player&apos;s hotbar
Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player&apos;s hotbar
It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with


Shelf storage affects a Comparator&apos;s output signal depending on which slots are occupied (MCPE-225226)
Each Shelf slot corresponds to 1 bit
The signal strength is determined by converting the 3 bits of the slots into a decimal value
All slots empty [000] means a signal strength of 0
Only the first slot occupied [100] means a signal strength of 1
Only the second slot occupied [010] means a signal strength of 2
Only the third slot occupied [001] means a signal strength of 4
All slots occupied [111] means a signal strength of 7

EditorWe are excited to announce Editor v1.1.0! To learn more about Editor and its multiblock world editing capabilities, check out the documents HERE, or learn how to build an Editor Extension HEREFeature Highlights in Editor v1.1.0Updated Flatten ToolThe Flatten Tool has been redesigned with new functionality and more flexible controls. You’ll now find a new Flatten mode within the Terrain Tool, along with two sub-modes: Flatten Up and Flatten Both, for better control over how terrain is leveled. New properties like FlattenSmoothing, FlattenIntensity, and FloorBlockOverride give you more customization. We’ve also added support for reading Cylinder Brush Shape properties (width, depth, height, radius, isUniform), and included the option to hide rotation controls. The previous version of the Flatten Tool has been removed.Line node weightsYou can now adjust the vertical and horizontal line weight for each node. This provides finer control over the thickness and shape of lines, making it easier to create more customized and organic-looking builds.Full Editor Changelogs

Entity Event ResponsesAdded the drop_item entity event response, which allows an entity to drop its item in a given slotGameplay
Fixed an issue where the player behaved incorrectly with the fixed boom camera when using the locked_player_relative_strafe control scheme. Player movement is now consistent with the free camera in this scenario
From 1.21.110 onward, the free camera and fixed boom cameras use Camera Relative Strafe as default scheme
Camera custom FOV command no longer requires the Experimental Creator Cameras experimental toggle
GeneralModels exported via Structure Blocks no longer use the missing texture for all block geometry (MCPE-223559)GraphicalChanged defaults for color grading contrast and saturation fields to 1. Previously the defaults were 1.2 and 1.05, respectivelyItems
Setting the &quot;minecraft:use_modifiers&quot; component&apos;s &quot;movement_modifier&quot; field to 1.0 now allows using the item while sprinting, and starting to sprint while using the item

Added the &quot;use_pixel_depth&quot; option to &quot;texture_meshes&quot; to control how geometry depth relates to texture resolution
If set to &quot;true&quot;, the geometry will have a depth of one pixel (in entity space, not texture space)This causes textures with a resolution different from 16x16 to appear stretched

If set to &quot;false&quot;, the geometry will be built from perfectly cubic voxels, regardless of the texture&apos;s aspect ratio
Defaults to &quot;true&quot; to ensure backward compatibility


Added Armor and Armor Toughness values to Armor tooltips (MCPE-152962)
&quot;poly_mesh&quot; is now documented as a deprecated featureIt was already treated as deprecated, but the documentation did not reflect this

All items that can be eaten now have the tag minecraft:is_food, except glow_berries
Item Components
Repairing an item using the minecraft:repairable item component no longer fails when a stack larger than strictly needed is used as repair material
Added the new minecraft:fire_resistant item component, which determines whether an item is immune to burning when dropped in fire or lava
Mobs
The minecraft:shareables component now also accepts item entries specifying item tags to name all items tagged as that to become shareable with the given settings
Foxes now use the minecraft:is_food tag instead of listing all foods manually, except glow_berries which is still listed manually

Fixed a bug where the minecraft:shareables component would mix attributes of duplicated entries in its items list. E.g. the priority would be taken from the first duplicated element and the max_amount from the last. Now the first &quot;matching&quot; entry will fully shadow those coming after it. Consider this items list in a minecraft:shareables using the new tag functionality:
&quot;items&quot;: [  
  { &quot;item&quot;: &quot;minecraft:apple&quot;, &quot;priority&quot;: 1, &quot;max_amount&quot;: 2 },
  { &quot;item&quot;: &quot;minecraft:is_food&quot;, &quot;priority&quot;: 0, &quot;max_amount&quot;: 1 }]    


Previously minecraft:apple would have had priority 1 but max_amount 1 instead of 2. Now it will correctly use all data from that first item apple entry.

World must have Upcoming Creator Features experiment enabled


Added new block component minecraft:flower_pottable
It is an empty component defined as such: minecraft:flower_pottable: {}
When the component is present on the block, &gt; a player can interact with an empty flowerpot when holding the block in order to embed it
Similar to other Vanilla pottable blocks, a player can remove the potted block by interacting with the pot with an empty hand
The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle
Pottable not potable


Added new block component minecraft:embedded_visual
The component has two required fields, &quot;geometry&quot; and &quot;material_instances&quot;, similarly to minecraft:item_visual
When the component is present on the block, it defines which geometry and material_instances to use when the block is embedded into another block, eg. into a Flowerpot
If the component is not present, embedded blocks fallback to their innate geometry and material_instances
The component cannot be defined in the &quot;permutations&quot; section; only one embedded visual can be achieved per block type


The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle


Added new field embeddedto the item_display_transforms object
The field defines the overall transformation this geometry should be subject to when embedded into a block, eg. a Flowerpot
If the field is not defined, the default transformation is a 0.75x scale, similar to the one applied to most Vanilla flowers

      <description>Posted: 5 August 2025Clonk! Clonk! Clonk! If you thought that’s the sound of a copper golem trying jazzercise, think again. It’s actually us digging deeper into experimental features only to discover that the Overworld is flat. Hang on, that’s not right either? But the Flat World presets in Bedrock now include the Void too! Throw in a number of bug fixes and how you can set your spawn point in the End, and you’ve got yourself our latest Bedrock release. Happy clonking mining!Experimental Game Drop FeaturesTo try out upcoming features, enable the Experimental Features toggle in your world settings. These features are still in development and may cause your world to crash, break, or become incompatible with future updates.Copper GolemCopper golems are handy, organization-loving companions that’ll bring your base to life! Summoned with copper and carved pumpkins, the copper golem removes items you leave in copper chests, and sorts them based on the item type into chests around your base!
Copper Golem will drop between 1 and 3 Copper Ingots when killed
Copper Golem can help with sorting items into Chests
Copper Golem Item Sorting
If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item
The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items
It can pick up max 16 items in a stack at the time
Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up
If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in
The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items -
It can place an item in a Chest if it&apos;s empty, or if it contains the same type of item it is holding in its hand
The Copper Golem will visit max 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item
If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again
The search area for chests from the Copper Golem&apos;s position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks
Copper ChestCopper chests are a new block! Summon a copper golem to get your first copper chest, which you can leave to oxidize, or keep pristine with wax. Drop items into a copper chest, and then sit back and relax as your copper golem sorts them into normal chests around your base!
Copper Chest is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants
Copper Chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other Copper blocks
Copper Chests can be crafted using a Chest and Copper Ingots
Copper ToolsWhat comes between stone and iron? Now the answer is: copper! Craft tools, weapons, and armor from copper, giving this early-game ore more uses than ever before. Unlike copper blocks, these items won&apos;t oxidize, but like all copper blocks - they will look beautiful!
Copper tools and weapons are crafted and repaired using copper ingots. They do the same amount of damage as stone but have higher durability. Copper tools work faster than stone tools, but they are slower than their iron counterparts. Copper tools have higher enchantability than diamond, but slightly less than iron.
Copper Axe
Copper Hoe
Copper Pickaxe
Copper Shovel
Copper Sword
Copper Armor
Copper armor has higher durability than leather but less than iron. Copper armor enchantability sits slightly lower than with iron.

Added the minecraft:behavior.take_block AI goal, allows an entity to take blocks from the world with the following options:
blocks: Array of block descriptors that the entity can take, if empty can take any block
can_take: Entity filters for when the entity can use the goal
on_take: Trigger ran if the entity does take a block
xz_range: XZ range from which the entity will try and take blocks from
y_range: Y range from which the entity will try and take blocks from
chance: Chance each tick to try and take a block
affected_by_griefing_rule: If the goal is affected by the mob griefing game rule
requires_line_of_sight: If the entity requires line of sight on the block it tries to take


Removed the minecraft:behavior.enderman_take_block AI goal, it upgrades to the above goal
Added the minecraft:behavior.place_block AI goal, allows an entity to place blocks in the world with the following options:
placeable_carried_blocks: Array of block descriptors that the entity can place if its carried item, if empty can place any block from its carried item
randomly_placeable_blocks: Array of weighted block descriptors that the entity can randomly place, if empty the entity will try to place the block in its carried item instead
can_place: Entity filters for when the entity can use the goal
on_place: Trigger ran if the entity does place a block
xz_range: X range from which the entity will try and place blocks in
y_range: Y range from which the entity will try and place blocks in
chance: Chance each tick to try and place a block
affected_by_griefing_rule: If the goal is affected by the mob griefing game rule


Removed the minecraft:behavior.enderman_leave_block AI goal, it upgrades to the above goal
Added the minecraft:behavior.transport_items AI goal, allows a mob to transport items from and to containers
Description:
If the mob is not carrying an item it will try to find a container matching source_container_types and will attempt to take an item from the first non-empty slot. It will take the largest of max_stack_size and the size of the stack in that slot. If the container is empty or it does not find a match it will remember this container as visited and search for the next container from which to pick up an item. If it fails to find an unvisited container from which to pick up items it will disable the goal for idle_cooldown seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has picked up an item it resets what containers it has visited.
If the mob is carrying an item it will try to find a container matching destination_container_types and attempt to put its carried item in it. It will put as much of the carried item as possible into the container. If it is still carrying an item (the container is full) it will remember the container as visited and try to find the next container to put items in. If it fails to find an unvisited container in which to put items it will disable the goal for idle_cooldown seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has stored items and is empty handed again it resets what containers it has visited.
If at any point the target container becomes an invalid target (the block could be removed or a chest could have a cat sit on it for example), the mob will mark the position as visited and move to the next target.


Fields:
source_container_types: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to get items from. Default is any container
destination_container_types: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to put items in. Default is any container
max_stack_size: The maximum stack size that the mob will try to take from a container. Default is 16
interaction_time: The amount of time spent interacting with the containers in seconds. Default is 3.0
allow_simultaneous_interaction: Whether the entity is allowed to simultaneously interact with a container that another non-player entity is already interacting with. Default is false
search_strategy: Whether to select the nearest valid container or a random valid container in range. valid values are &quot;nearest&quot; or &quot;random&quot; (default).
search_distance: The maximum horizontal and vertical distance at which to find containers for taking or placing items. Default [62, 32]
max_visited_containers: The maximum number of containers the mob will visit before resetting. 0 is unlimited and default is 16
initial_cooldown: Time, in seconds, the mob will wait after spawning or after its available goals have changed (e.g. due to a component group update). Default is 0
idle_cooldown: When the mob cannot find a valid container to interact with, the goal will be disabled for this amount of time in seconds. Default is 20
place_strategy: governs which container contents the goal is allowed to add to:
&quot;with_matching&quot;: Only allows placing item in a container already having stack(s) of item.
&quot;with_matching_or_empty&quot;: Like the above, but additionally allows placement in empty containers.
&quot;any&quot;: Puts no restriction, allows placement of item in container as long as there is space. This is the default behavior.


allowed_items: A list of item descriptors that are the only items the mob is allowed to transport. If non-empty disallowed_items must be empty. Default is empty (all items allowed)
disallowed_items: A list of item descriptors that are the mob is not allowed to transport. If non-empty allowed_items must be empty. Default is empty (no items disallowed)


Requirements and limitations:
Initially the component requires the 2025 Drop 3 experiment to be enabled but it will be generally available in a later update
A navigation component is needed to enable the mob to navigate to the container. E.g. minecraft:navigation.walk
At the moment Chests, Copper Chests, Barrels, and Shulker Boxes are the only supported containers




Add-Ons and Script Engine
Custom biome names are no longer implied by their filenames. Biome names are explicitly specified via the &quot;identifier&quot; property under the &quot;description&quot; sub-object of their JSON definition.
Biome identifiers must now be namespaced (ex: &quot;minecraft:plains&quot;). Client biomes with a format version lower than 1.21.90 will have their identifier automatically prefixed &quot;minecraft:&quot; when loaded if no namespace is already specified.
Updates biome documentation to match updated biome JSON formatting and requirements.
Biomes client settings now look up settings based on the biome&apos;s full name, including its namespace. Vanilla biomes will fall back on their name without a namespace if an exact match is not found before falling back on default settings (for example, &quot;minecraft:plains&quot; will match itself, then &quot;plains&quot; if no setting was found)
API
Moved custom commands from beta to 2.1.0.
Moved Player command permissions from beta to 2.1.0.
Fixed a bug where the includeLiquidBlocks property on BlockRaycastOptions would not correctly result in hits on liquids if it didn&apos;t also reach a solid block afterward.
Fixing a crash with the DebugDrawer when used too early in the client joining a world (such as inside the playerSpawn event).
The message parameter of the setText method on BlockSignComponent no longer accepts a RawText as an option. This option was redundant as it is covered by the existing RawMessage option. This affects the setText method in all versions. .
Updated many error strings to use consistent punctuation.
The properties minValue and maxValue on the ArgumentOutOfBoundsError class are now optional. .

Updated several APIs to throw ArgumentOutOfBoundsError instead of Error where appropriate. .
This affects the following APIs in all versions:

Entity.addEffect for when the amplifier setting is out of bounds (0 - 255) or duration setting is out of bounds (1 - 20000000).
Entity.applyImpulse for when the vector parameter is out of bounds (-1000 - 1000 per axis).
ItemStack.setLore and ContainerSlot.setLore for when the loreList parameter is out of bounds (0 - 100 max lines, 0 - 1000 max length per line).
ItemStack.setAmount and ContainerSlot.setAmount for when the amount parameter is out of bounds (0 - 255).



Some existing errors that throw ArgumentOutOfBoundsError have been updated to use a standardized error message. .
This affects the following APIs in all versions:

ScreenDisplay.setTitle for when the fadeInDuration, stayDuration or fadeOutDuration settings are out of bounds (min value of 0).
StructureManager.placeStructure for when the integrity setting is out of bounds (0 - 1).
PlayerAimAssist.setAimAssistSettings for when the viewAngle setting is out of bounds (10 - 90) or distance setting is out of bounds (1 - 16).
ItemStack.setNameTag and ContainerSlot.setNameTag for when the nameTag parameter length is out of bounds (0 - 255).


Some existing errors that throw InvalidArgumentError have been updated to use a standardized error message. .CustomSpawnRulesRegistry.registerObstructionCallback for when the predicate parameter is empty or a duplicate.

Added new error class EntitySpawnError which is thrown when an entity fails to spawn via the spawnEntity method on Dimension
Updated many methods to throw custom errors to provide better context and information of the problem that occurred

ItemInventoryComponentBundle UI now renders non-contiguous items added to the container with this API correctly.

Removed minecraft:destruction_particles&apos;s block API from beta . It was determined to not release this server side script to stable due to it&apos;s reliance on client driven functionality.
Added class InvalidItemStackError to beta.

Biomes
Adding a new server side biome component surface_builder that will combine the components surface_parameters, frozen_ocean_surface, mesa_surface, swamp_surface, capped_surface, and the_end_surface into one component. Each biome can only use one builder type. The component can be used for world generation settings such as foundation material and sea floor depth.
Added &quot;minecraft:humidity&quot; component with &quot;is_humid&quot; this forces a biome to either always be humid or never humid. Humidity effects the spread chance, and spread rate of fire in the biome.
Added &apos;minecraft:partially_frozen&apos; This component will impact the temperature in a frozen biome, causing some areas to not be frozen. Ex: patchy ice, patchy snow.
Commands
Added the fov_set keyword to the /camera command for changing the camera&apos;s field of view. Enabled with the Experimental Creator Camera toggle
&apos;locate structure&apos; command (and similar structure-searching gameplay elements) will now quickly return no result if experimental Custom Biomes have replaced all of the biomes where that structure could appear
GameplayWhen loading a chunk that used a removed custom biome, the removed biome is now replaced with the dimension&apos;s default biome, which is Ocean in the overworldJigsaw

Happy Ghast
The Happy Ghast is a new mountable flying mob.
Dried Ghast Block

The Dried Ghast block is found in Nether Fossil structures and is the first stage of the Happy Ghast mob
Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand block and 8 Ghast Tears
When waterlogged, it undergoes 3 hydration level changes over approximately 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
The hydration level decreases when it is no longer waterlogged, using the same timescale
The hydration level is not preserved when mined
Makes sounds and shows particles depending on its hydration level
The Dried Ghast block emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes

Ghastling Mob

The Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob
Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes
After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:

Players within a 16-block radius or
An adult, non-aquatic passive mob or some of the neutral mobs within a 16-block radius


If no player or suitable mob is close around, the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position where it spawned or was last interacted with

It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home position


Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs
Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes, or faster if fed Snowballs

Happy Ghast Mob

Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to four players
Tempted by Snowballs and Harness

The Happy Ghast can only be tempted with a Harness when it has no harness equipped


Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds
The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting above it in the front seat

When controlled, the goggles of the Happy Ghast flip down to cover its eyes


Players mounting after the first player are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player
Pressing the sneak key dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
If the Happy Ghast detects players standing on top of it, it ceases all movement and rotates to the closest cardinal direction

This happens regardless of whether it has a Harness equipped or not


When mounted on the Happy Ghast, the third-person camera is further away from the player
When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, it starts its roaming behavior

If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it starts roaming
The roaming behavior is similar to the Ghastling, except for the radius being 64 blocks
When wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast roams closer to the home position, within a 32 block radius
When leashed, the Happy Ghast has a roaming distance of 10 blocks
The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming


Cannot be bred
Cannot enter boats
Has no panic behavior when taking damage

Harness Item

The Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it
The Harness comes in 16 different colors
Can be crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass blocks and 1 Wool block

The Harness will have the same color as the Wool block used when crafting


Can be re-dyed in the crafting grid
Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears when no players are mounted

 
Locator Bar
The Locator Bar is a new UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.

If another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) the Locator Bar will display in the same area as experience bar

When experience is gained the experience bar will appear
If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal


Facing other players within a 120 degree range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar

Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow together with their indicator
The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
Colored indicators are randomized for each player

Operators can modify the colors of indicators with the /waypoint command

e.g.: /waypoint modify @s color red to set an indicator to red


Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color




Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar

However, spectators are visible to each other


The Locator Bar can be toggled off by setting the locatorBar game rule to false


Music and Sound

Added a new music disc:

&quot;Tears&quot; by Amos Roddy

Can be obtained by killing a Ghast with a Fireball deflected by a Player
Has a comparator output of 10 when played in a Jukebox

Advancements

Added new &quot;Stay Hydrated!&quot; Husbandry Advancement when a Dried Ghast block is placed into Water

Leash Changes

The Slime Ball in the Lead recipe has been replaced with a String
Improved leash mechanics, with reworked leash physics, allowing for more stable leash connection, especially when leashed entities are not on ground

When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the entity holding the leash
Using a Firework Rocket when flying with leashed entities will now break the leash connections


Leashes are now rendered twice as thick, matching Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
Leashes can now be used to leash two mobs together

Sneak-interact on any mob while holding leashed mobs will leash these mobs to the entity interacted with
Re-leashing an entity is prevented if the re-leashing would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance


Leashes can be snipped from an entity when interacting with them using Shears

This applies to its own leash connection as well as all entities attached to it
Dispensers can now snip leashes from entities in front of them when they are equipped with Shears


When leashing an already leashed mob, their previous leash snaps
You cannot steal leashed entities from other players
Interactions with a Leash Knot/Fences:

Fails for entities that are not in range of the Leash Knot/Fence
All entities leashed to the player will be leashed to the Leash Knot/Fence
Transfers all its leashed entities to the player if the player has no entities leashed
Sneak-interact only ever attaches leashes
Shearing or punching the Leash Knot will result in all current connections to be broken


A Leash Knot requires at least one connection to exist
Boats and large mobs that can be leashed but cannot fit in a Boat (Horses, Donkey, Mule, Camel and Sniffer) can be leashed in a special quad connection to the Happy Ghast

Happy Ghast will also show a custom layer when it&apos;s leashing something using a quad connection
Entities leashed in quad connection are now rendered without slack

Leash snapping distance has been changed from 10 to 12 blocks

Happy Ghast has a leash snapping distance of 16 blocks
The distance between two leashed entities is determined based on the center of their bounding boxes, rather than their feet





Saddle Changes
Crafting Saddles

Saddles can now be crafted with 3 Leather and 1 Iron Ingot
The recipe is unlocked when a player picks up their first Leather

Removing Saddles and Equipment

Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses and Carpets can now be removed from the mobs by using Shears

This does not work in case the mob has a rider, or if the player is crouching
Saddles cannot be removed from Ravagers using Shears


Dispensers with Shears cannot remove Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses or Carpets equipped on mobs
Shearing Saddles, Horse Armor, and Carpets will emit a vibration frequency of 6, along with the Unequip frequency of 4

Loot Table Changes
The following loot tables have had Saddles removed from them and replaced with 1-5 Leather:

Monster Room chests
Ancient City chests
Desert Pyramid chests
Jungle Pyramid chests
Stronghold altar chests

Fog

Fog was tweaked for improved atmospheric perspective
It now becomes foggier when it rains
Fog is now applied to 3D HUD elements such as first-person player hands and items in hands

Ambient Desert Block Sounds Changes

Ambient sand sounds no longer require sky access to play
Ambient sand sounds now have a slightly decreased chance to play
Terracotta blocks no longer trigger ambient sand sounds
Sand blocks no longer trigger ambient wind sounds
Terracotta blocks no longer trigger ambient wind sounds

Music and Sound

The following sound categories have been renamed:

Friendly Creatures -&gt; Friendly Mobs
Hostile Creatures -&gt; Hostile Mobs


Rules for when ambient desert blocks sounds play have been tweaked

Realms

Changed the layout of the Realms configuration screen to use tabs

The Worlds tab allows changes to any of the world slots, creating new worlds and changing their settings
The Players tab allows management of the players that have access and their level of access to the Realm
The Subscription tab allows management of the Realms subscription
The Settings tab allows changing the settings of the Realm


Introduced a Region Preference setting that allows for more granular control over what region a Realm is hosted in
Changed wording for Close/Open Realm to Temporarily close/Reopen Realm
Added the Realms logo to the Realms loading screens
Added region information when connecting to a Realm

Projectile Targeting

The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time

Previously, all projectiles had a target tolerance margin of 0.3 blocks
Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight
After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin
This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away



Splash Potions

Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed

This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion
If the entities are grouped together, they will receive the same effect strength



Technical Changes

The Data Pack version is now 80
The Resource Pack version is now 63
All JSON files (in worlds, packs, configuration, etc.) are now parsed in strict mode
Pressing F3 + V now prints client-side version information

Arguments:


entity-selector: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see waypoint_transmit_range attribute)

color: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint

hex &lt;hex-color&gt; arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)

Red is either hex F00 or hex FF0000

Waypoint Broadcasting
The Locator Bar works through a server-controlled Waypoint system. Waypoints are received by Players, and connections between Waypoints and Players are managed by the multiplayer server.

Individual Players can have their transmission and receive ranges controlled by the waypoint_transmit_range and waypoint_receive_range attributes

Dialogs

Dialogs are stored in a minecraft:dialog registry, but can also be defined inline
Dialogs are an experimental feature
To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title

Clicking on this warning leads to a screen that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content
It also gives the user an option to leave the current world to avoid them being locked in an infinite loop of dialogs
If a new dialog is received by the client while warning screen is visible, it will not replace it, but when user clicks the &quot;Back&quot; button, the new dialog will be restored instead


Dialogs can be displayed by server in play and configuration connection phases

However, only inline registries are allowed in configuration, since registries are not yet available in that phase
Additionally, run_command click event is not available in configuration phase


Dialogs by default will close after the Escape key is pressed

When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as &quot;exit action&quot; below
This behavior is configurable


When the dialog screen is closed, the game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay

That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any


Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu

This replaces and expands the &quot;Server Links&quot; button added in previous versions


New key bind called &quot;Quick Actions&quot; has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs
Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:

Header with title and warning button
Body elements, scrollable if needed:

messages and items
inputs
actions buttons


Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions




Developer&apos;s Note: Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users. This feature is intentionally limited to match that use case.

 
Dialog Description Format

Dialogs are stored in minecraft:dialog registry that can be provided by a datapack

Fields:


type - one of dialog types from minecraft:dialog_type registry

&lt;type-specific&gt; - see below

Common Dialog Fields

Most dialog types share some fields. To avoid duplication, they are listed in this section

Fields:


title - screen title, text component

Should be always visible on screen, no matter the specific type



external_title - name to be used for a button leading to this dialog (for example from Pause screen), optional text component

If not present, title will be used instead



body - optional list of body elements or a single element, see below

inputs - optional list of inputs, see below

can_close_with_escape - can dialog be dismissed with Escape key, default true


pause - should the dialog screen pause the game in single-player mode, default: true


after_action - additional operation performed on dialog after click or submit actions, default: close


close - closes dialog and returns to previous non-dialog screen (if any)

none - do nothing, i.e., keep the current screen open

only available if pause is false to avoid locking the game in single-player mode



wait_for_response - replace the current dialog with a &quot;Waiting for Response&quot; screen

this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on laggy connections

servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog


to avoid accidental locking, a &quot;Back&quot; button will become active after 5 seconds

clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e., game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any)


&quot;Waiting for Response&quot; screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game

&lt;type-specific&gt; - see below, depends on type




Static Dialog Action Types
All existing click_event actions (except for open_file) are included as dialog action types.
Uses same format as click_event on text components (but with action replaced with type) For example, when using show_dialog, the entry for action button will look like this:
{    &quot;label&quot;: &quot;some label&quot;,    &quot;action&quot;: {        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;show_dialog&quot;,        &quot;dialog&quot;: &quot;some:id&quot;    }}

minecraft:dynamic/run_command Action Type

This action will build a run_command event using a provided macro template
The macro will be expanded with string values from inputs

For example, if the macro template is some_command $(some_input), the string value from input with key of some_input parameter will be used for the template expansion
Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string



Fields:


template - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command


minecraft:dynamic/custom Action Type

This method will build a minecraft:custom event using all input values
All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from key field of that input
Additional static fields can be added to payload

Fields:


additions - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag

id - namespaced ID

Built-in Dialogs
The built-in datapack contains some custom dialogs to provide customization of specific screens used by the client.
minecraft:server_links

Replacement for the previously existing &quot;Server Links&quot; screen
Meant to simplify migration for servers that previously used this feature

minecraft:custom_options

Shows contents of minecraft:pause_screen_additions tag (see below)
Allows the user to select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries
Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful not to hide other dialog providers

Dialog Command

New command has been added to show dialog to clients

Syntax:


dialog show &lt;targets&gt; &lt;dialog&gt; - show dialog to player(s)


&lt;targets&gt; - player name, UUID or a player selector

&lt;dialog&gt; - a namespaced ID from minecraft:dialog registry or inline dialog value as described above
Returns the number of players in targets argument



dialog clear &lt;targets&gt; - clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible


&lt;targets&gt; - player name, UUID or a player selector
Returns the number of players in targets argument



Pause Screen Configuration

A data pack can request some of the available dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen
This feature replaces the &quot;Server Links&quot; button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in external_title field
This feature is configured by minecraft:pause_screen_additions dialog tag:

If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent server_links packet, the tag will be handled as if it contained minecraft:server_links dialog

Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty


If this tag is still empty, the button will not be visible (&quot;Send Feedback&quot; and &quot;Report Bugs&quot; buttons are visible instead)
If this tag has a single element, the pause screen button will lead directly to that dialog
If this tag has multiple elements, the pause screen button will lead to a minecraft:custom_options dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements

If this dialog is removed, the button is will not be visible





Quick Actions Key Bind

A new key bind has been added that allows users to access a set of dialogs
Default key: G

This feature is configured by minecraft:quick_actions dialog tag

If this tag is empty, the key bind will do nothing
If this tag has a single element, the key bind will open that dialog
If this tag has multiple elements, the key bind will lead to minecraft:quick_actions dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements

If this dialog is removed, the key bind will do nothing




This option is intended for use in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty in the Vanilla pack

Text Components
Click Events

Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the run_command click action in books and chat if the command can&apos;t be parsed or requires elevated permissions (i.e., higher than 0)

Added minecraft:custom


A new click action called minecraft:custom has been added

When user clicks a component with this click action, the client will send a dedicated packet minecraft:custom_click_action to a server
The intended use is as an alternative for run_command to be used by modded servers without worrying about having to add custom commands
This packet has no functionality on Vanilla servers
Fields:


id - namespaced ID

payload - optional tag field





Added minecraft:show_dialog


A new action called show_dialog has been added

When user clicks this component, a dialog will be opened for them
Fields:


dialog - a namespaced ID from minecraft:dialog registry or inline dialog value as described above





Game Rules
Added locatorBar


Default is true: enabling the Locator Bar
Changing to false will remove all existing Waypoints from all players

Attributes
Added camera_distance


Default value: 4.0

Modifies the distance at which the camera is placed away from the player or spectated entity when in a third-person view
If the entity being ridden has a larger camera_distance attribute, that distance will be used
This distance is multiplied by the scale attribute to get a final target camera distance

Added waypoint_transmit_range and waypoint_receive_range



Default: 0.0, Minimum: 0.0, Maximum: 60000000.0


Players have a default transmission and reception range of 60,000,000


Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers that are within that range


Similarly, receivers only receive waypoints that are inside their reception range (and receive nothing if that range is zero) Examples:


/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0 will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)


/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80 will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)


/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0 will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator Bar)


/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120 will only let a player see Locator Bar dots that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)


Changed flying_speed


The flying_speed attribute now also applies to Ghasts and Happy Ghasts

Data Components

equippable Item Component

Added a new optional field: can_be_sheared (boolean)

If true, players can use Shears to remove this equippable item from a target mob by right-clicking, provided all other shearing conditions are satisfied
If not specified, it defaults to false



Added a new optional field: shearing_sound (sound event)

It&apos;s a sound event that plays when the equippable item is sheared
If not specified, it defaults to the item.shears.snip sound event




attribute_modifiers Item Component

Added an optional display field to attribute_modifiers entries

There are 3 display types:


default - Current behavior of showing the calculated attribute modifier values on the tooltip

hidden - Does not show the attribute modifier entry

override - Replaces the shown attribute modifier text

Contains a single field value for the text contents to show for this attribute modifier entry








painting/variant Item Component

No longer accepts inline variants

Entity Data

Added the home_pos and home_radius fields to all mobs

Mobs with set home position will limit their pathfinding to stay within the indicated area
Some mobs, such as Bats, Slimes, Magma Cubes, Phantoms and Ender Dragons may ignore it
Interacting with leashes or riding may change the home position of the mob



area_effect_cloud

The Particle field has been renamed to custom_particle, and now always functions as an exact override for the default colored entity_effect particle

The field will not be written if no override is specified
The color will no longer be inherited from the potion contents when specifying the entity_effect or tinted_leaves particle types



tnt

The entity that primed the TNT is now stored in an optional owner field (UUID of Living entity)

vex

The owner of a Vex is now stored in an optional owner field (UUID of mob)

#plays_ambient_desert_block_sounds has been renamed to #triggers_ambient_desert_sand_block_sounds

Added triggers_ambient_dried_ghast_block_sounds - blocks that can trigger ambient Dried Ghast sounds to play when a Dried Ghast block is placed on them

Item Tags

Added #happy_ghast_food - items that can be used to feed Happy Ghasts
Added #happy_ghast_tempt_items - items that can be used to tempt Happy Ghasts

Entity Tags

Added #can_equip_harness - entities that can equip the Harness items
Added #followable_friendly_mobs - non-baby entities that will be followed by Baby Happy Ghasts

Waypoint Styles
These define custom icons to be displayed on the Locator Bar and are within the waypoint_style/ asset directory.


near_distance and far_distance are optional and default to the values 128 and 332 respectively


far_distance distance must be greater than near_distance




sprites is a list of at least one sprite IDs within the prefix of hud/locator_bar_dot/ (the directory textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot)
An example &quot;bowtie&quot; waypoint style is provided and accessible via the command:

/waypoint modify &lt;entity-selector&gt; style set bowtie


When the distance to the waypoint is less than near_distance, the first sprite in the list will be selected
When the distance to the waypoint is greater than far_distance, the last sprite in the list will be selected
Between this range, sprites will be selected based on the linear progress between the near and far distances

Sounds

Changed location on the sounds for Glow Squid, Squid, Guardian, Horse, Rabbit and Pufferfish from entity folder to the mob folder
Added entity/leashknot/break for when a Lead snaps

UI Sprites

The mob effect atlas has been removed, and sprites in the textures/mob_effect/ folder are now included within the GUI atlas

This means mob effect sprites now support GUI sprite scaling properties


Added icon/music_notes and toast/now_playing sprites

Font
Unifont

Updated Unifont to 16.0.03
Added previously omitted Unifont glyphs for Private Use Areas

Those glyphs are loaded as a separate sub-font minecraft:include/unifont_pua and are not included in any normally used font
Characters in those areas are managed by Under-CSUR (Under-ConScript Unicode Registry), which adds various scripts not present in official Unicode set, like Tengwar or Sitelen Pona




unihex Font Provider

The size_overrides field is now optional (defaults to empty list)

Equipment Assets

Added new happy_ghast_body layer type, rendering in the body slot of the Happy Ghast

Item Models

Item model definitions now have a boolean field oversized_in_gui which is false by default

If true, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot
If false, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in gui
This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it
At some point in the future we hope to replace it with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality


Introduced new item model minecraft:player_head to handle player profile texture loading and rendering
Removed support for minecraft:profile from minecraft:head



minecraft:player_head Special Model Type

Renders a player head
Uses profile from minecraft:profile component to load a texture. Renders a default texture until the profile texture is fully loaded
No fields


minecraft:head Special Model Type

No longer supports profile from minecraft:profile component to load a player texture
Renders a default player texture when kind is player and no texture override is supplied
Fields remain unchanged

Block Models


elements[].rotation.angle value in block models is no longer limited to multiplies of 22.5 degrees and can now be any angle from -45 to +45


Shaders &amp; Post-process Effects

Developer&apos;s Note: Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game&apos;s internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.


All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms
Custom uniforms provided to post-process shaders are now uniform blocks
Uniform definitions inside json files are now per-block

Post-process Effect Definitions

Entries in the targets map have been expanded to support new properties

New optional boolean field: persistent (default: false)

If true, this render target will be persistent across frames
The contents of the target will be cleared when the screen is resized


New optional field: clear_color (default: [0, 0, 0, 0])

Format: integer ARGB value, or float array in order [R, G, B, A]

When this target is created or cleared, it will be filled with this color




The uniforms values is now a list-per-block, instead of a global list

e.g. uniforms: { &quot;UniformBlockName&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;vec2&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: [...] } ] }

The order of uniforms in a block must match the order in the shader





name as part of a uniform definition is no longer used

We encourage setting it to help keep the json file organized/readable, but the game won&apos;t use it



value as part of a uniform definition replaces the old values, and the type depends on the type field

This field is required

&quot;type&quot;: &quot;int&quot; needs &quot;value&quot;: 123 (a single int)

&quot;type&quot;: &quot;float&quot; needs &quot;value&quot;: 123.4 (a single float)

&quot;type&quot;: &quot;vec2&quot; needs &quot;value&quot;: [1.2, 3.4] (two floats)

&quot;type&quot;: &quot;vec3&quot; needs &quot;value&quot;: [1.2, 3.4, 5.6] (three floats)

&quot;type&quot;: &quot;ivec3&quot; needs &quot;value&quot;: [1, 2, 3] (three ints)

&quot;type&quot;: &quot;vec4&quot; needs &quot;value&quot;: [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8] (four floats)

&quot;type&quot;: &quot;matrix4x4&quot; needs &quot;value&quot;: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0] (four rows of four columns of floats)


We do not validate that the uniform block is valid for a given shader, giving incorrect information will cause undefined and funky behavior

Post-process Effect Shaders

Instead of every uniform being an individual opaque type, they are now grouped in uniform blocks

They will be set according to the pass definition in the json file, and may be shared across both vertex and fragment shaders


The list of sizes (all vec2 *Size uniforms) are now replaced with a single SamplerInfo uniform block

This contains, in order, the size of the output texture followed by the size of every input texture
The order of textures in the definition file will dictate the order of samplers in this uniform
For most post chains this is just OutSize and InSize as before
All sizes are vec2




post/bits.fsh

Expects a BitsConfig of float Resolution and float MosaicSize


post/blit.fsh

Shader Fog Changes

The fog is now split into environmental and render-distance-based fog
Previously both those concepts were mixed in the same uniforms
Environmental fog is supposed to represent the &quot;fogginess&quot; of the environment the player is in

e.g. lava, water, and now also atmosphere


Render distance fog is supposed to obscure the border of visible terrain
Environmental fog uses spherical distance to determine its intensity, render distance fog uses cylindrical distance
The resulting fog value for any given vertex is the maximum of both


Globals Uniform Block

Available through #moj_import &lt;minecraft:globals.glsl&gt; for convenience
Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don&apos;t normally use it
Contains ScreenSize, GlintAlpha, GameTime and MenuBlurRadius (new)


MenuBlurRadius is the blur radius of the background when a menu is open




Fog Uniform Block

Available through #moj_import &lt;minecraft:fog.glsl&gt; for convenience
Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don&apos;t normally use it
Contains FogColor, FogEnvironmentalStart (new), FogEnvironmentalEnd (new), FogRenderDistanceStart (renamed from FogStart), FogRenderDistanceEnd (renamed from FogEnd), FogSkyEnd (new) and FogCloudsEnd (new)


FogSkyEnd is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing for the sky

FogCloudsEnd is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing the clouds

FogRenderDistanceStart is the render distance fog start

FogRenderDistanceEnd is the render distance fog end

FogEnvironmentalStart is new and represents the start of environment-based fog

FogEnvironmentalEnd is new and represents the end of environment-based fog

FogShape was removed. Render distance fog is now cylindrical and environmental fog is spherical




Projection Uniform Block

Available through #moj_import &lt;minecraft:projection.glsl&gt; for convenience
Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don&apos;t normally use it
Contains ProjMat with no changes


DynamicTransforms Uniform Block

Available through #moj_import &lt;minecraft:dynamictransforms.glsl&gt; for convenience
Is no longer available to shaders that do not normally use it
Contains ModelViewMat, ColorModulator, ModelOffset, TextureMat, LineWidth

These are very likely to change in the near future
The values of some of these are often hard coded and may not make sense for a given shader, i.e., LineWidth in any non-line based pipeline




Lighting Uniform Block

Available through #moj_import &lt;minecraft:light.glsl&gt; for convenience
Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don&apos;t normally use it

The values may not make sense if the shader wouldn&apos;t normally expect it, however


Contains Light0_Direction and Light1_Direction



CloudInfo Uniform Block

Only available to the cloud shaders (rendertype_clouds.vsh/rendertype_clouds.fsh)

Contains CloudColor, CloudOffset and CellSize (new)


CellSize contains the size of an individual cloud cell






LightmapInfo Uniform Block

Only available to the lightmap shader (lightmap.fsh)
Contains AmbientLightFactor, SkyFactor, BlockFactor, UseBrightLightmap, NightVisionFactor, DarknessScale, DarkenWorldFactor, BrightnessFactor, SkyLightColor with no change in behavior

Features and Bug Fixes
Blocks
Dried Ghast

Can be found in the Nether in Nether Fossil structures
Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand Block and 8 Ghast Tears
When waterlogged it undergoes 3 states over about 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
Makes sounds and shows particles depending on state
If mined during the waterlogging, it will revert to its “dry” state regardless of what state it has reached during waterlogging
Will revert states back to its initial “dry” state when it is taken away from being waterlogged, using the same time scale
Piglins can give Dried Ghast Blocks when bartered with
Added new achievement &quot;Stay Hydrated!&quot;


Mobs
Ghastling
Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob


Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes


After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:

Players within a 16-block radius or

An adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius



If no player or suitable mob is close around the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or was last interacted with)


Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs


Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes (or faster if fed Snowballs)


Can be summoned using the command: /summon happy_ghast ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_baby


Happy Ghast
The Happy Ghast is a new flying mount that can carry up to four players

Spawns from a Ghastling after about 20 minutes (or faster if Ghastling is fed Snowballs)
Can be equipped with a harness and then be mounted by up to 4 players
Tempted by Snowballs and Harness. Harness tempting only works if the Happy Ghast is unharnessed
Has no panic behavior when taking damage
Cannot be bred
Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds are rendered
The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting in front of the Happy Ghast, just above its face
When a player mounts, the goggles on the Happy Ghast go down to cover its eyes, indicating that it can now be controlled
Other players who mount after the pilot is mounted, are placed in slots on each side of the Happy Ghast, starting clockwise from the “pilot” player
Pressing crouch button dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
If the Happy Ghast detects players on top of it, it then ceases all movement and aligns to the closest cardinal horizontal direction
This happens regardless of it having a harness equipped or not
3rd person camera is moved back when player is mounted on the Happy Ghast
When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, the goggles go up and the Happy Ghast starts to roam around the home position
If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it resumes roaming
Cannot enter Boats
Idles around within 64 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with)
If wearing a harness, the Happy Ghast idles closer to the home position (within 32 blocks)
The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming on its own

Items
Harness
Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it

Crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass Blocks and 1 Wool Block, the Harness will have the same color as the Wool Block used when crafting
Can be re-dyed
Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears but only when no players are mounted

Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new UI element on the Player HUD that displays the direction of other Players in the World
When there are multiple Players in a World, the Locator Bar will appear on-screen for each Player, replacing the Experience Bar. The Player Level number will still be visible as before above the Locator Bar
The Locator Bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards another Player. If another Player is 30 degrees above or below the camera&apos;s viewport (the screen) an up or down arrow will be displayed
Crouching will hide the Player, preventing their indicator from appearing on the Locator Bar of other Players
Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
A Mob Head or a Carved Pumpkin will similarly hide Players from the Locator Bar when worn in the head slot.
Using a Potion of Invisibility will also hide players from the Locator Bar

Saddles Updates

We are making Saddles craftable and generally making it easier to remove them from mobs by using Shears. We have also added Leather to some loot tables instead of Saddles

Crafting Saddles


Saddles can now be crafted with 3 Leather and 1 Iron Ingot


Recipe popup happens when a player picks up their first Leather


Loot Table Changes
Some loot tables have had Saddles removed from them and replaced with 1-5 Leather:

Monster Room chests
Ancient City chests
Desert Pyramid chests
Jungle Pyramid chests
Stronghold altar chests

Leashing Updates
We are expanding the functionality of leads, to make it possible to leash any leashable entity to another leashable entity and by doing so create chains of leashed entities


Attaching a leashed entity to another entity and using Shears to cut leashes now take precedence over other interactions

Example: Attempting to shear a leashed Sheep will now un-leash it instead of shearing it



Leash break distance is now calculated between the centers of the two entities&apos; collision boxes, aligning with the rest of the leash physics calculations


Elytra

Using a Firework Rocket to boost while flying with an Elytra now causes leashed mobs to unleash

Leash Knots

Entities can now be leashed to a pre-existing Leash Knot by interacting with it
Players can retrieve entities tied to a Leash Knot by interacting with it

Leashing Entities to Other Entities
Any leashable entity can now be leashed to any other leashable entity

To leash an entity to another entity, the player must:

Have the entity already leashed to themselves
Sneak and interact with the target entity while holding the leash


Leashed entities can now be &quot;stolen&quot; by leashing them again, transferring ownership to the player
If re-leashing an entity would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance, the re-leashing cannot be done
To prevent erratic behavior when leashed to each other, Llamas that are leashed no longer attempt to form caravans
A leashed entity cannot be leashed to itself
Baby mobs can only be leashed one way - to another entity; they cannot have other mobs leashed to them
Known issue: When two mobs are connected, it results in the lead being rendered with an erroneous y-axis offset and appearing below one of the mobs

Physics
All leashable entities now behave more naturally when being pulled

When leashed to a Happy Ghast, Horses, Camels, Donkeys, Mules, Boats, Chest Boats, and Sniffers now adjust their position gradually over time, aligning smoothly with their leash holder when suspended mid-air
In all other cases, entities align to the direction they are being pulled and no longer behave erratically when suspended mid-air
Mid-air friction now applies to Boats just like any other entity, meaning they can no longer orbit the player or behave excessively bouncily
The distance at which leashes break has been increased to 12 blocks, except for the Happy Ghast, which has a leash break distance of 16 blocks
When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the leasher
The distance between centers of entities bounding boxes, rather than their feet is used to determine the distance between two leashed entities

Rendering

Boats and large leashable mobs that cannot fit in a Boat (Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Camels, and Sniffers) when leashed to a Happy Ghast are rendered with four leashes instead of one
In this configuration, the harnessed Happy Ghast also features a custom rope layer wrapping around it

Shearing Updates


Shears can now be used on leashed entities to unleash them, removing both incoming and outgoing leash connections


Shears can now be used to remove Leash Knots


Players cannot cut other players&apos; leashes


Dispensers can now use shears to unleash leashed entities


Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets can now be removed from the mobs they can be equipped on by using Shears


Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets cannot be removed by using Shears while the mob has a rider


Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets cannot be removed by using Shears while the player is sneaking


Saddles cannot be removed from Ravagers using Shears


Dispensers with Shears cannot remove Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, or Carpets equipped on mobs


Removing Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets using Shears now plays custom sounds


Music

Added the following new music tracks by Amos Roddy to Cherry Groves, Forest, Desert, Grove, and Lush Cave Biomes:

Below and Above
Broken Clocks
Fireflies
Lilypad
O&apos;s Piano


Added a new Music Disc with the track &quot;Tears&quot; by Amos Roddy
The Ghast now drops the &quot;Tears&quot; Music Disc when killed by a Fireball deflected by a Player

Vibrant Visuals

Vibrant Visuals is Minecraft&apos;s biggest official visual enhancement - delivering a dazzling cosmetic upgrade with a new modern graphics pipeline and an array of visual improvements. Sunrises are more vivid, water reflects, forests become shaded, and more!
Vibrant Visuals preserves what makes Minecraft uniquely special - pixelated shadows, caustics, and reflections have been carefully crafted to preserve and enhance Minecraft&apos;s signature blocky style
With updated textures for blocks, items, and more that decide how different light sources interact with them, builds will become more vivid and visually interesting!
Updated art settings and post-processing effects tie the visuals together in a signature Minecraft way
As a cosmetic enhancement to the game, Vibrant Visuals does not impact Minecraft&apos;s gameplay, meaning you can play on Realms with friends whether they have Vibrant Visuals enabled or not (Realms subscription sold separately. Multiplayer functionality will require platform specific online subscriptions, also sold separately)

Editor
We are excited to announce Editor v1.0.0! With this milestone Editor is officially out of beta. To learn more about Editor and its multiblock world editing capabilities, check out the documents HERE, or learn how to build an Editor Extension HERE
Feature Highlights in Editor v1.0.0
Updated Movement Controls
Editor just got a serious upgrade! 🎮 We&apos;ve revamped the movement controls to make navigation smoother and more intuitive. The default up/down keys are now E and Q, freeing up Shift and Space for other actions. You can now toggle mouse mode with the T key, and scroll zooms toward your cursor for better control. We&apos;ve also added middle-click drag to pan across the XZ plane, plus Z and C keys to orbit around your block cursor. Need a broader view? Use SHIFT+Z and SHIFT+C to orbit around your entire selection. Dive in and explore with ease! 🧭
Vibrant Visual Settings Improvements
We&apos;ve made it easier to fine-tune your visual style with updates to Vibrant Visual Settings! 🌇 New controls give you more flexibility when adjusting lighting, atmosphere, and other visual elements. We&apos;ve also added time-of-day scrubbers, so you can instantly see how your settings look across different times of day—making it simpler to achieve the perfect mood for your world.

Pick blocks by color in the Block Picker
Building just got more colorful! 🌈 You can now filter blocks by color in the Block Picker, making it easier to focus on aesthetics over specific block types. Whether you&apos;re going for bold gradients or matching a vibe, this new feature helps you create highly visual builds with ease. Let your creativity shine! 🎨✨
Hollow Selection Trim Action
Added a new Hollow trim action to Selection. This trim action converts your current selection into a new selection volume representing only the fully enclosed non-air blocks—perfect for hollowing out brush-shaped structures and creating internal spaces with ease.
Line Tool Improvements
Added new mouse controls and hotkeys to the Line Tool for faster, more flexible editing. You can now left-click to add connected points or Ctrl+click to add disconnected ones. New shortcuts let you nudge points, adjust line thickness, convert to selection, and more—all designed to streamline your building workflow.

Fixed the minecraft:follow_orbit camera not having the correct control scheme in its allow list


Fixed the camera_relative_strafe control scheme


Deprecated align_target_and_camera_forward. Use control_scheme to switch between control schemes instead


Goals

&quot;minecraft:rideable&quot; component&apos;s &quot;dismount_mode&quot; is now correctly applied when passengers are forced to dismount by the &quot;minecraft:behavior.float&quot; goal

Graphical


Added the ability to data-drive some of the Vibrant Visuals / Deferred Graphics related settings per biome. Creators can provide multiple versions of atmospherics, color grading, lighting and/or water configurations as long as each has a unique identifier and file name. The reserved JSON names for each group of settings (e.g., lighting/global.json) will continue to function as before. Creators can utilize the minecraft:atmosphere_identifier, minecraft:color_grading_identifier, minecraft:lighting_identifier, and minecraft:water_identifier in Client Biome JSONs to connect particular rendering settings to a given biome. Note that certain parameters, such as tone mapping operators, caustics and wave simulation on/off cannot be customized per biome at this time. Parameters will be spatially blended as players move between biomes. See updated Creator Documentation for more details


Particles rendered without the &quot;minecraft:particle_appareance_lighting&quot; component are now rendered as expected in Vibrant Visuals


Removed &apos;;&apos; debug feature for toggling graphics modes


Recalibrated all emissive values in MERS textures in Vibrant Visuals


Update shadow configurations for &quot;Favors Performance&quot; targets on all Xbox platforms in Vibrant Visuals mode


Update Volumetric configs for &quot;Prefers Performance&quot; targets on Xbox One and Xbox One X in Vibrant Visuals mode


Reduced the intensity and speed of the caustics animation in Vibrant Visuals


Fixed an issue where the screen would render black on Xclipse GPUs running Android 15 with Vibrant Visuals (MCPE-203972)


Increased emissive intensity and adjusted tone mapping parameters in Vibrant Visuals.


Added temperature grading settings to the color grading JSON files for Vibrant Visuals. Schemas must specify a format version of 1.21.90 to access this new setting

New temperature object added to color_grading


enabled set to true or false controls if temperature grading is enabled

type set to either white_balance or color_temperature controls the type of grading applied


white_balance uses the temperature value to adjust the camera&apos;s white point. Lower temperature values will cause the scene to appear more blue

color_temperature is the inverse of the white balance operation. Lower temperature values will cause the scene to appear more red



temperature sets the temperature in kelvin
Example:
...&quot;color_grading&quot;: {    &quot;temperature&quot;: {        &quot;enabled&quot;: true,        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;color_temperature&quot;,        &quot;temperature&quot;: 6500.0    }}...




Added henyey_greenstein_g settings to the fog JSON files

New section henyey_greenstein_g allows specifying value for both air and water

Example:



{    &quot;format_version&quot;: &quot;1.21.90&quot;,      &quot;minecraft:fog_settings&quot;: {        &quot;description&quot;: {            &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;minecraft:test_henyey_greenstein_g&quot;        },        &quot;volumetric&quot;: {            &quot;henyey_greenstein_g&quot;: {                &quot;air&quot;: {                    &quot;henyey_greenstein_g&quot;: 0.5                }            }        }    }}


Items equipped in off-hand will no longer be displaced when the game is paused (MCPE-190716)


Fix inconsistent cloud rendering during split-screen gameplay (MCPE-188934)


Fixed an issue with 0 being incorrectly discarded on the g and a values of on_fire_color inside render controllers. This caused entities like the Ghast&apos;s fireballs to be tinted green. (MCPE-218297)


Items


Extended &quot;minecraft:wearable&quot; item component to allow hiding Players&apos; locations, similar to Mob Heads and the Carved Pumpkin

The new &quot;hides_player_location&quot; boolean field defines whether Players are hidden on the Locator Bar and Locator Maps when equipped in the appropriate wearable slot, defined by the &quot;slot&quot; field
The default value of &quot;hides_player_location&quot; is false
All &quot;minecraft:wearable&quot; item components defined previously will have the value of &quot;hides_player_location&quot; default to false



Molang


Fixed query.health in resource packs to return 0 for the Wither once it has died

Blocks

Added minecraft:random_offset component under the Upcoming Creator Features toggle. This allows for blocks to randomly offset like foliage does in the Vanilla gameExample:

{      &quot;format_version&quot;: &quot;1.21.80&quot;,    &quot;minecraft:block&quot;: {       &quot;description&quot;: {          &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;test:test_block&quot;       },       &quot;components&quot;: {          &quot;minecraft:collision_box&quot;: {             &quot;origin&quot;: [-4.0, 4.0, -4.0],             &quot;size&quot;: [8, 8, 8]          },          &quot;minecraft:random_offset&quot;: {             &quot;x&quot;: {                // This is the range of possible values we can pick from                &quot;range&quot;: {                   &quot;min&quot;: -4,                   &quot;max&quot;: 4                },                // This is the equally spaced steps across the given range.                 // Provide 0 for all possible values in the range                &quot;steps&quot;: 16             },             &quot;y&quot;: {                &quot;range&quot;: {                   &quot;min&quot;: -4,                   &quot;max&quot;: 4                },                &quot;steps&quot;: 16             },             &quot;z&quot;: {                &quot;range&quot;: {                   &quot;min&quot;: -4,                   &quot;max&quot;: 4                },                &quot;steps&quot;: 16             }          }       }    }


Added minecraft:movable component under the Upcoming Creator Features toggle. This allows for blocks to configure how they should react when moved by a Piston

&quot;movement_type&quot; (Required): Specifies how the block should react when moved by a piston

&quot;push_pull&quot;: Will allow a block to be pushed by a Piston/Sticky Piston and pulled by a Sticky Piston (e.g. Grass)
&quot;push&quot;: Will allow a block to be pushed by a Piston/Sticky Piston (e.g. Glazed Terracotta)
&quot;immovable&quot;: Will not allow a block to be pushed or pulled by a Piston/Sticky Piston (e.g. Bedrock)
&quot;popped&quot;: Will pop a block when pushed by a Piston/Sticky Piston (e.g. Leaves)


&quot;sticky&quot; (Optional): Specifies how the block should handle adjacent blocks when moved by a Piston

&quot;none&quot;: Default. Will not add any additional behavior
&quot;same&quot;: Will move adjacent blocks along with it when moved by a piston. It will not move different blocks with &quot;sticky&quot;: &quot;same&quot; (e.g. A Honey Block can move another Honey Block but not a Slime Block)

NOTE: This field only works when used with &quot;movement_type&quot;: &quot;push_pull&quot; &quot;format_version&quot;: &quot;1.21.90&quot;,&quot;minecraft:movable&quot;: {&quot;movement_type&quot;: &quot;push_pull&quot;,&quot;sticky&quot;: &quot;same&quot;







Block Components


Added field &quot;uv_lock&quot; to &quot;minecraft:geometry&quot; block component behind UpcomingCreatorFeatures experiment

UV locking will allow faces to have the same texture orientations as the default geometry state, regardless of how &quot;minecraft:transformation&quot; component rotates the geometry
UV locking will not be supported for geometry using Box UVs if the box sides are not equal, in other words the box has non square UVs. Geometry with per-face UVs and non-square faces will be supported
UV locking will not be supported if Block Json format_version is less than 1.19.80.



Commands

Added optional property liquidSettings to /place structure and /place jigsaw commands. Defaults to apply_waterlogging


Jigsaw


Jigsaw structures being placed in water no longer replace water incorrectly


Added optional property liquid_settings to minecraft:jigsaw JSON to allow control over handling liquids when placing structures. Defaults to apply_waterlogging.


Components
