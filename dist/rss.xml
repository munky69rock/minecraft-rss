(Beta) Player method clearPropertyOverridesForEntity can now take an Entity or Entity ID as valid arguments
Graphical

Deprecated point_lights/global.json in favor of a new file and schema, local_lighting/local_lighting.json. Creators can still make use of point_lights/global.json, but are encouraged to migrate to the new schema

Extended per-block local lighting information to include a light_type which can be either static_light or point_light
A block will only be considered for point lighting if its light_type is set to point_light


static_light is currently unused


The light_color property is now optional. If unprovided, the block will use a fallback light color instead
A sample local_lighting.json could look like this: &quot;format_version&quot;: &quot;1.21.120&quot;, &quot;minecraft:local_light_settings&quot;: { &quot;minecraft:torch&quot;: { &quot;light_color&quot;: &quot;#EFE39D&quot;, &quot;light_type&quot;: &quot;point_light&quot; }
Learn more at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/lightingcustomization



Updated point light tracking to be able to link to custom blocks. Learn how to apply point lights to custom blocks at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/lightingcustomization
The RenderDragon Features for Creators experiment now includes a resource pack that will be automatically loaded when entering a world with the experiment enabled (MCPE-227624)</description>

Copper Chest

The Copper Chest is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants
Copper Chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other Copper blocks
A Copper Chest can be crafted using a Chest and 8 Copper Ingots

Copper Golem

The Copper Golem is a new mob which can be spawned by placing a Jack o&apos;Lantern or Carved Pumpkin on top of a Copper block
Copper Golems oxidize over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
If the Copper Golem is fully oxidized and not waxed it will turn into a Copper Golem Statue

Upon turning into a statue, the Copper Golem will drop any item it may be holding
The statue retains the Copper Golem&apos;s name


Copper Golems can help with sorting items into Chests
Interacting with the Copper Golem with an empty hand will make it drop its carried item
Iron Golems will occasionally plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem

The flower can be removed with Shears
This flower is dropped when the Copper Golem turns into a Copper Golem Statue




Copper Golem Item Sorting

If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item

The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items
It can pick up at most 16 items in a stack at a time
Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up


If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in

The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items
It can place an item in a Chest if it&apos;s empty, or if it contains the same type of item that it is holding in its hand


The Copper Golem will visit at most 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item
If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again
The search area for chests from the Copper Golem&apos;s position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks


Copper Golem Statue Block

The Copper Golem Statue is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants
The Copper Golem Statue oxidizes over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
If the Copper Golem Statue has no oxidation when interacted with using an Axe, the statue will turn into a Copper Golem
The Copper Golem Statue can be in one out of four poses: standing, sitting, running, and star

The pose of the statue can be changed by interacting with it
Each pose emits a Redstone Comparator signal




Copper Equipment

Added Copper Nugget
Added Copper armor

Added Copper Helmet, Copper Chestplate, Copper Leggings and Copper Boots
Copper armor has higher durability than Leather and Gold
Copper armor has slightly less enchantability than Iron


Added Copper tools and weapons

Added Copper Axe, Copper Hoe, Copper Pickaxe, Copper Shovel and Copper Sword
Copper tools and weapons do the same amount of damage as Stone, but have higher durability
Copper tools work faster and last longer than Stone
Copper tools have higher enchantability than Diamond, but slightly less than Iron


Copper equipment can be crafted using Copper Ingots
Copper equipment can be repaired with Copper Ingots
Copper equipment turns into a Copper Nugget when smelted
Added Copper Horse Armor

Has the same loot table and chance of generating as Iron Horse Armor
Armor toughness: 4




Copper Decorations

Added Copper Torch

A green variant of the Torch crafted from a Copper Nugget, Coal, and Stick
Functionally identical to the Torch


Added Copper Bars

Functionally identical to the existing Iron Bars block
Made from copper and oxidizes over time


Added Copper Chain

Functionally identical to the existing Chain block (now renamed to Iron Chain)
Made from copper and oxidizes over time


Added Copper Lantern

Crafted similarly to a regular Lantern but uses Copper and a Copper Torch
The lantern itself oxidizes, changing its look as it ages
Functionally identical to the Lantern




Shelf

The Shelf is a new type of decorative block which comes in the following variants:

Oak
Spruce
Birch
Jungle
Acacia
Dark Oak
Mangrove
Cherry
Pale Oak
Bamboo
Crimson
Warped


The Shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any Stripped Log, Stripped Stem or Block of Stripped Bamboo, filling the top and bottom row

This recipe produces 6 Shelves


The Shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:

Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player&apos;s main hand item with the content of that slot
The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame


While a Shelf is powered by Redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it&apos;s powered

When powered, up to 3 Shelves will connect to each other
Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player&apos;s hotbar
Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player&apos;s hotbar
Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player&apos;s hotbar
It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with




Lightning Rod

Lightning Rods now oxidize like other Copper blocks

The End Light Flashes

The End dimension now has skylight

Normally the skylight does not affect how the dimension looks
From time to time flashes in the sky happen and produce a rumbling sound
When they happen skylight intensity increases, flooding the dimension with purple light


While the Ender Dragon fog effect is active the flash source in the sky is not visible and the brightness of the light affecting the world is reduced
The &quot;Hide Sky Flashes&quot; accessibility option disables the End flashes

When the flash is disabled by the setting the world is not lit by the flash but the flash source is still visible in the sky and the sound effect still plays




Minecraft Server Management Protocol
Added a server management API (JSON-RPC over WebSocket) for dedicated servers

The API is disabled by default and can be enabled in server.properties

management-server-enabled=true
management-server-host=localhost
management-server-port=0


The API is accessible at ws://&lt;management-server-host&gt;:&lt;management-server-port&gt; when enabled
Supports querying and updating of server state (players, allowlist, operators, settings, game rules)
Sends notifications on state changes (e.g. player joins, game rule updates)
Calling {&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;rpc.discover&quot;} returns an API schema containing supported methods and notifications of the currently running server
The Data Generator produces an API schema (json-rpc-api-schema.json) in the reports output folder mirroring the contents returned by the rpc.discover method
The API adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification

Uses namespaced methods and the reserved namespaces are minecraft (e.g. minecraft:players, minecraft:allowlist/add)

Extensible via custom namespaces for additional methods and events


Core method groups: players, allowlist, operators, server (save, stop), server settings, game rules
Example method call:

Request: {&quot;method&quot;:&quot;minecraft:allowlist/add&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;params&quot;:[[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;jeb_&quot;}]]}

Response: {&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;result&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;jeb_&quot;}]}



Example notification:

{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;minecraft:notification/players/joined&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;jeb_&quot;}]}


Example error:

Request: {&quot;method&quot;: &quot;minecraft:foo/bar&quot;,&quot;id&quot;: 1}

Response: {&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;result&quot;:{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;error&quot;:{&quot;code&quot;:-32601,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Method not found&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:&quot;Method not found: minecraft:foo/bar&quot;}}}

Errors and error codes follow JSON-RPC 2.0 error object format



Clients must authenticate to access the API

Clients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server-specific secret
The secret is configured in server.properties

management-server-secret=
The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty
Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized




TLS is enabled by default

Can be disabled in server.properties

management-server-tls-enabled=false


Requires a keystore file to be set in server.properties

management-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12


The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format
Keystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority

Environment variable: MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD

JVM argument: -Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password=

Server property: management-server-tls-keystore-password=






Chat Drafts

Unsent chat messages now get saved as Chat Drafts if the chat was forcibly closed

This includes it being closed by external sources such as dying or a dialog opening, but not the player intentionally closing their chat


Any existing Chat Draft will get pre-filled into the message box the next time the chat is opened
Draft text has a grayed-out appearance until fully restored

Draft text can be restored as regular text by interacting with it:

Typing additional text
Moving the text cursor using the arrow keys
Clicking it
Highlighting it


Pressing enter on a Chat Draft prior to it being restored sends it like a normal chat message
Pressing backspace on a Chat Draft prior to it being restored deletes it


Added an option to the Chat Settings screen that enables saving unsent chat messages by default

With this option enabled, unsent messages will always get saved as Chat Drafts, even if the player intentionally closed their chat



Server Code of Conduct
When connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown

Accepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server
A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future

If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again



Server Setup

A new boolean field has been added to server.properties called enable-code-of-conduct

Setting it to true will make the server look for Code of Conduct files in the codeofconduct subfolder in the same folder as server.properties

Each file in the folder should have the form &lt;language_code&gt;.txt and be UTF-8 encoded

The language shown will attempt to match the player&apos;s language
If it doesn&apos;t exist, the en_us Code of Conduct will be used
If that also doesn&apos;t exist, an arbitrary available entry is used





Sounds

Some sound sliders in the Music &amp; Sound Options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world

Accessibility

The &quot;Attack/Destroy&quot; and &quot;Use Item/Place Block&quot; key binds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either &quot;Hold&quot; or &quot;Toggle&quot; in the Controls screen
Added &quot;Invert Mouse X&quot; option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis
Added &quot;Sprint Window&quot; option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint
Multiple key binds that have the same key assigned to them can now work together, while before only one would work

For example, you can now bind D to Jump and Strafe Left to jump and strafe left at the same time
The red warning for assigning the same key to multiple key binds is changed to yellow


The spectator hotbar menu key can now be rebound

It is part of a new Spectator category in the Key Binds screen, alongside the pre-existing Highlight Players key bind



Changes

Performance improvements
The Chain block has been renamed to &quot;Iron Chain&quot;
Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful

The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg


Changes to world loading and the &quot;Spawn Chunks&quot;
A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered &quot;active&quot; and will keep processing chunks and entities

Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded


Reworked the debug overlay to be less cluttered and more configurable
Players seen in the game world of the current server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen even if they are offline
Players now stop flying when switching from Spectator Mode to Creative Mode if they are near the ground

A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, Happy Ghasts, boats...) within 1 block below them
Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity

This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground




Migrated several server properties into game rules
OpenGL 3.3 is now required to play the game, up from 3.2. This does not change our posted Minimum Requirements


Developer’s Note: We do not expect the update to OpenGL version to affect many people, if any at all. Our posted Minimum Requirement has been OpenGL 4.0 since 2017, and OpenGL 3.3 turned 15 years old recently.

Performance Improvements

Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance

You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms
FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs


Particles outside the player&apos;s view are not rendered anymore, which provides a performance improvement in some cases

World Loading and Spawn Chunks

The concept of fixed &quot;Spawn Chunks&quot; has been removed
The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were:

Chunks loaded by the forceload command
Chunks active due to portal activity
Thrown Ender Pearls (Singleplayer only)
A small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only)
Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only)


The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn
The loading screen now has a progress bar

This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading mentioned above




Developer’s Note: Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into.


However, we also want to recognize that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option.


We believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or Ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking.

Server Properties
Several server properties were removed in favor of making them into game rules, allowing these settings to be changed while the server is running

Removed server property allow-nether in favor of the new game rule allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals

Removed server property spawn-monsters in favor of the new game rule spawnMonsters

Removed server property enable-command-block in favor of the new game rule commandBlocksEnabled

Removed server property pvp in favor of the new game rule pvp

Added server property management-server-enabled controlling whether the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is enabled or not

Defaults to false



Added server property management-server-port controlling on what port the Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started

Defaults to 0, assigning an available port each time management server is started


Added server property management-server-host controlling with what host the new Minecraft Server Management Protocol is started

Defaults to localhost



Added server property management-server-tls-enabled controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not

Defaults to true



Added server property management-server-tls-keystore controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS

Defaults to an empty string
A dedicated server won&apos;t start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided


Added server property management-server-tls-keystore-password controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS

Defaults to an empty string


Added server property status-heartbeat-interval controlling the interval the management server sends heartbeat notifications to connected clients

Defaults to 0, meaning it’s disabled


Added server property enable-code-of-conduct

Details on this property can be found in the &quot;Server Setup&quot; header



Game Rules

Removed spawnChunkRadius game rule
Added pvp game rule controlling whether players can deal damage to other players

Defaults to true



Added allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals game rule controlling if the Nether can be entered through portals

Defaults to true



Added spawnMonsters game rule controlling if monsters should spawn naturally

Defaults to true



Added commandBlocksEnabled game rule controlling if Command Blocks should be enabled or not

Defaults to true



Added spawnerBlocksEnabled game rule controlling if Spawner Blocks should be enabled or not

Defaults to true




Mob Spawning

The logic for choosing a type of equipment for mobs spawning with equipment has been tweaked to add Copper as a possibility

The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between Leather, Copper and Gold
The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87%



Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

Test Instance Blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads
Ambient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the game

The underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction
This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or &quot;hollow&quot; such as:

Worn armor
Worn Elytra
The outside layers on player skins
The rib cages of Skeletons or Skeleton Horses
The feet of Chickens or Frogs
The wings of Phantoms or the Ender Dragon
The fins on fish
And more!





Recipes

Changed the Copper Trapdoor recipe to use 4 Copper Ingots instead of 6 and now yields one Copper Trapdoor instead of two

Sounds

The Happy Ghast is now audible from 64 blocks
Sounds for Chests now play at a lower volume
The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value
The &quot;Voice/Speech&quot; sound source has been rephrased to &quot;Narrator/Voice&quot;

UI

The Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box
More text inputs now support selecting text by mouse dragging
Double-clicking a word in an edit box now selects it
When adding a new server to the server list, the server name is no longer prefilled

When omitted, the default name &quot;Minecraft Server&quot; is used



Mouse cursor

Some UI components will now change the shape of the mouse cursor

Examples: text inputs, numeric sliders, buttons, scroll bars


Additionally, clickable parts of text labels (like links) will now change the cursor to the &quot;hand&quot; shape
This feature can be disabled with the &quot;Allow Cursor Changes&quot; option in the Mouse Settings screen

Debug Overlay

The debug overlay is accessible by pressing F3, as before
The debug overlay can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world
It is now less cluttered, displaying less information by default
Added a new Debug Options screen, available by pressing F3 + F6, which can be used to configure what debug information should be displayed

For each element, you can configure whether it should be visible in the debug overlay or not, and can even set it to always be visible regardless of the debug overlay being active
Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this Debug Options screen
Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the Debug Options screen
The state of the Debug Options screen is saved between launches of the game
The Debug Options screen has the following preset profiles:


Default resets everything to the default state

Performance shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible






Developer&apos;s Note: Previously, gathering the information every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check your FPS noticeably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in the Performance profile should not affect game performance.

Chat

It is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal
The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension

Accessibility

Dye Colors now have updated icons

The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility


A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen

The &quot;Auto-Jump&quot; option, as well as the &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Sprint&quot; toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen


The &quot;Show Subtitles&quot; option has been rephrased to &quot;Closed Captions&quot; to more accurately describe what it does
The &quot;Hide Lightning Flashes&quot; accessibility setting has been renamed to &quot;Hide Sky Flashes&quot; as it includes the End light flashes

Technical Changes

Pack versions now have minor versions
The Data Pack version is now 88.0
The Resource Pack version is now 69.0
Some previously hidden debug features have been exposed to players

Pack Formats

The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions

A minor version increment of the game&apos;s pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working


Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version

Pack Metadata
The pack.mcmeta format has been updated:

The supported_formats field has been removed

If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack &lt; 82, resource pack &lt; 65), it is still required
Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed


The pack_format field is now optional

If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack &lt; 82, resource pack &lt; 65), it is still required


Added required field min_format - specifies the minimum version supported

A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1]

Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. 74 is the same thing as [74, 0]

Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone


Added required field max_format - specifies the maximum version supported

A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g. [74, 1]

Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is 0x7fffffff

Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone


For overlay entries:

The formats field has been removed

If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack &lt; 82, resource pack &lt; 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions
Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed


Added required fields min_format and max_format with the same formats as the fields above with the same name for the pack section



Debug Features

Some debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players
Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties:

First, a global debug flag must be enabled with -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED or -DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true

Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN or -DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true

To get the list of all available debug properties, add -DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES



Warning: this is debug code, and the primary intention is to help modders - not for normal play. Handle with extreme care!

Features can crash your game or corrupt your worlds
Features are not guaranteed to work as intended
Features might be added, changed or removed without a notice



Data Pack Versions 82.0 Through 88.0

Added Mannequin entities
World Borders can now be set per dimension
Added a way to use GUI and item sprites in text
Player profiles in data components and block entities no longer resolve automatically
Added fetchprofile command for downloading player profiles
Renamed chain to iron_chain


Mannequins
Added a new type of technical entity called minecraft:mannequin which can only be spawned with summon commands.

A Mannequin is a Player Avatar without a connected Player
Mannequins show a description text (by default entity.minecraft.mannequin.label) where a Player&apos;s below_score score would show
Mannequins function as Living Entities - they can hold and wear equipment, have attributes &amp; effects, take damage, etc.
Mannequins accept the minecraft:profile component from spawner items

Data Fields:


profile - Which Player profile to show on the entity (same format as a minecraft:profile component), defaults to {} (i.e. static profile with both id and name missing)

hidden_layers - List of outer skin layers to hide

Valid entries: cape, jacket, left_sleeve, right_sleeve, left_pants_leg, right_pants_leg, hat




pose - The pose of the mannequin

Valid entries: standing, crouching, swimming, fall_flying, sleeping




main_hand - Which hand is the main hand of the Mannequin - one of left and right


immovable - Optional boolean specifying that the Mannequin cannot be moved (defaults to false)

description - Optional Text Component shown where a Player&apos;s below_score score would show

The default entity.minecraft.mannequin.label text is shown if omitted



hide_description - Optional boolean specifying that no description should be shown at all

A Mannequin with the description hidden displays as if a Player had no below_score display




World Border

The World Border is now dimension-specific

This means that each dimension can have its own World Border size, position, etc.



Text Rendering

object Text Component

New text component with type object has been added
This component will display a non-character object as a part of text
Sprites are always rendered as a rectangle, 8x8 pixels in size

Bold and italics styles are ignored


Format:


object: type of object, string, see below for values

&lt;type-specific&gt;: additional fields depending on object type


Similarly to the nbt text component, the object field can be omitted

However, it&apos;s recommended to provide it for error checking



atlas Object Type

Renders a single sprite from a sprite atlas as a character
Format:


atlas: namespaced ID of a sprite atlas, default value: minecraft:blocks


sprite: namespaced ID of a sprite in the atlas, for example item/porkchop




General note about atlas contents:

Sprite Atlases contain textures for items, blocks, mob effects, GUI elements, etc.
The contents are controlled by files in the assets/minecraft/atlases/ directory in a resource pack
The current contents can be reviewed with the F3+S key combination

player Object Type

Renders a player head
If a partial profile is given, the skin is resolved in the same way as the minecraft:profile component on a player head
Format:


player: player profile


name: player name, optional string

id: player uuid, optional UUID

properties: profile properties, optional map



hat: controls rendering of a hat layer, boolean, default true





run_command Click Event

Previously, if the command field contained a command that required a signed message (/say, /me, /msg, /tell, /w, /teammsg, /tm), it would be silently discarded
Instead, a screen will be shown that lets the user insert the command into the chat window or copy the command to their clipboard if the chat window can&apos;t be opened

Commands

The summon command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful
The spawnpoint and setworldspawn commands now have control over the full player look direction

The angle argument has been removed
Added an optional rotation argument which requires both yaw and pitch to be specified


The setworldspawn command is no longer limited to the Overworld

This means players can respawn e.g. in the Nether when they have no Bed or Respawn Anchor


Server commands now run from the respawn dimension by default instead of always running in the Overworld

Added fetchprofile


A new command that has been added to fetch the contents of a player profile from Minecraft servers
Since the operation might take some time, it works asynchronously while the game keeps running
After successful completion, a message will be printed that lets the user perform various actions:

Copy the contents of a fully resolved minecraft:profile component
Get a Player Head with the resolved profile
Summon a Mannequin with the resolved profile
Copy a text component to display the player head in text


Since the result is not known at the time of execution, this command always returns 1


Syntax:


fetchprofile name &lt;player name&gt; - resolves profile by name (case-insensitive)

fetchprofile id &lt;uuid&gt; - resolves profile by id

Data Components
Modified minecraft:profile

New Resolution Behavior

Previously the contents of this component would permanently change when the profile was resolved, i.e. downloaded from Minecraft services
To avoid issues with this unexpected change, the resolved value is no longer stored and contents of the profile will always remain unchanged
That means this component now has two behaviors:

Static: when it has the properties field or when both name and id are present or when both are missing

In this state, the profile will always render as-is
If the properties field is missing, a default skin will be used (selected based on id, same as in offline mode)
That means the skin will be frozen at the moment of component creation
This option is preferred for decorative uses


Dynamic: when it has either name or id set (but not both)

When an item containing this profile is rendered on the client side, the profile will be resolved to most recent value
This means that this item will always render with the current skin of the targeted player

Note: if a player changes their skin while the game is running, the change will not be visible until the client restarts


The resolution might happen with a delay, during which the item will render with a default skin
The profile name will replace the item name only when it is present

Items with just id will show the default name


Items with dynamic profiles are distinguished from static ones with a label in their tooltip




Items stack based on exact contents, so even if a dynamic component is eventually resolved to the same profile as a static one, they won&apos;t stack together
Player heads in older maps that have not been loaded in newer versions yet will usually be converted to dynamic contents

Player Skin Overrides

Profiles can now also have additional fields that can replace various values used for rendering
If any of the fields are omitted, the value from the resolved profile is used, even if the profile resolves to the default skin
New fields


texture - Optional namespaced ID of the skin texture to use for rendering

The skin is specified relative to the textures folder and with a .png suffix
e.g. entity/player/wide/steve will use the default wide Steve skin



cape - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use for rendering

When specified, uses the same format as the texture field



elytra - Optional namespaced ID of the Elytra texture to use for rendering

When specified, uses the same format as the texture field
If this value is not present either as an override or in a player profile, Mannequins using this profile will use the cape texture, or if that is also not present, the default Elytra texture when wearing an Elytra



model - Optional model type, one of wide and slim





blocks_attacks Item Component

If the damage reduced in an attack is 0, for example by the angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking

Entity Data
Modified minecraft:player


Changes to the respawn object


angle has been renamed to yaw and is now a required field

pitch has been added as a required field

dimension is now a required field



Block Entity Data
Modified minecraft:skull



profile field has been changed to match minecraft:profile component

That means that it also becomes immutable and is resolved only when necessary



Loot Tables

Added minecraft:entity_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters:


target_entity, the entity being interacted with

interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the target_entity


tool, the tool used to interact with target_entity



Added minecraft:block_interact loot table type which takes the following parameters:


block_state, the block state of the block entity being interacted with

block_entity, the optional block entity being interacted with

interacting_entity, the optional entity that is interacting with the block_state


tool, the optional tool used to interact with block_state



Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as entity_properties.entity, can additionally target the target_entity and interacting_entity parameter types
Added charged_creeper/root loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper

This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables:

charged_creeper/piglin
charged_creeper/creeper
charged_creeper/skeleton
charged_creeper/wither_skeleton
charged_creeper/zombie


Once any killed mob drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table


Added brush/armadillo loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed
Added gameplay/turtle_grow loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult
Added harvest/beehive loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears
Added harvest/cave_vine loot table for drops when a Cave Vine with Glowberries is harvested by interacting with it
Added harvest/sweet_berry_bush loot table for drops when a Sweet Berry Bush with Sweet Berries is harvested by interacting with it
Added carve/pumpkin loot table for drops when a Pumpkin is carved using Shears

Enchantments

explode Effects
New field: block_particles - specifies per-block particles. Each block particle is randomly chosen according to weights. A set limit of block particles is spawned each tick from all explosions that tick.
Format: List of entries:


weight: Non-negative integer representing the random weight for this entry being chosen

particle: The particle to spawn

scaling: Optional scaling to apply between explosion center and block position, or 1.0 if not specified

speed: Optional scaling to apply to the speed of the particle, or 1.0 if not specified

World Generation

The initial_density_without_jaggedness field in noise_settings definitions has been replaced with a preliminary_surface_level field


initial_density_without_jaggedness was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than 0.390625


preliminary_surface_level is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface
The minecraft:find_top_surface density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning



Density Functions
Added minecraft:find_top_surface

Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function
It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive

The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface as possible for best performance
The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface



Fields:


density - density function to approximate the surface of

upper_bound - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value

lower_bound - integer, lowest possible y-value

cell_height - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan

Added minecraft:invert

Resolves to 1/argument


Fields:


argument - density function

Jigsaw Structures

The max_distance_from_center field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal

This can be specified by an object with fields:


horizontal - required integer between 1 and 128


vertical - optional integer between 1 and 4096 (default: 4096)
e.g.: &quot;max_distance_from_center&quot;: { &quot;horizontal&quot;: 20, &quot;vertical&quot;: 500 }



The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported

Shaders &amp; Post-process Effects

Developer&apos;s Note: Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game&apos;s internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future.

Shaders

The following unused shaders have been removed:

core/position_color_lightmap.vsh
core/position_color_lightmap.fsh
core/position_color_tex_lightmap.vsh
core/position_color_tex_lightmap.fsh


A new PER_FACE_LIGHTING flag has been added to the following shaders:

core/entity.vsh
core/entity.fsh


When set, cardinal lighting will be computed separately for front- and back-faces
As we now require OpenGL 3.3, we have bumped the version of all shaders from 150 to 330


Changes to Full Screen Passes

The following vertex shaders have been removed, and replaced by core/screenquad.vsh:

core/blit_screen.vsh
post/blit.vsh
post/blur.vsh
post/invert.vsh
post/sobel.vsh
post/screenquad.vsh


Vertex shaders for post-processing effects, as well as lightmap generation and full screen blits are no longer are passed the Position attribute, and instead must assign vertex coordinates by gl_VertexID

These passes furthermore are only executed with 3 vertices, instead of a full quad

Fixed bugs in 1.21.9


MC-383 - In the world selection screen, world names/versions/timestamps can overflow the list to the right

MC-2681 - No loading progress bar whenever we create a new world or when the game is loading something

MC-26334 - Chat UI is forcibly cleared when killed

MC-36783 - Item frames/Glow item frames don&apos;t change their hitbox if they contain a map

MC-46503 - You can retain entities&apos; shaders by running the &quot;/kill&quot; command while in spectator mode

MC-46634 - Thunder volume is not affected by weather volume settings

MC-59413 - Water and lava can drip from barriers

MC-69216 - Switching to spectator mode while fishing keeps rod cast
